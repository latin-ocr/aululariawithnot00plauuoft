INTRODUCTION. 41

The last instance should be explained from the analogy
of the simple form venis, which would, of course, fall under
the general rule.

A very strong instance of a shortened final syllable

occurs in the Bacchides (48) :

p6teris agere .- atque 13 dum veniat, sedens ibi opperibere.

For even if we readily grant that an η before an s dis-
appears in many instances, the long quantity of the e
would still remain unaltered: but for all that we must
here admit a short pronunciation of the syllable ens.
Ritschl changes the reading of the mss, by transposing
atque ibi sedens, dum is veniat, opperibere. Fleckeisen ad-
heres to the authority of the mss.

All these short quantities are, of course, of but occa-
sional occurrence ; but they suffice to provi the large ex-
tension of a very dangerous propensity of the Latin
language in Plautus' time, which was fast making its
way and has left permanent traces. I do not forget that
such strong violations of natural prosody as those given
above, cannot be otherwise than shocking to an ear ac-
customed to Augustan prosody, and I am fully awai-e
that many scholars will therefore treat 1116111 with obsti—
nate incredulity: but an impartial consideration of the
matter would show that there is at least no rational
difference between the shortening of at &t {t and of cis ἒε

notion of the short quantity of the suffixes of the third
pers. sing. at the time of our first acquaintance with
Latin prosody 3 the latter appears strange to us, because
the literary language of the so-called classica] epoch pre-
served the original long quantity. To be brief, most people
readily acknowledge the fait accompst, while they obsti-
nately close their eyes to the traces left by a destructive
and revolutionary power in the popular speech of a cer-
tain period, because the same tendencies were afterwards
theoretically checked and resisted and could not, there-
fore, manifest themselves in the literary dialect of a more
cultivated period. But for such as are determined not
