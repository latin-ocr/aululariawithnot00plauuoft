154. perendie ‘the day aster?
this is the original meaning os
this word which will thus be
constantly met with in Plautus.
Comp. the phrase used in the
leyis actiones ‘in diem tertium

Rhein. Mus. xlx 606) and Mero.

Megadorus seems to have the
same opinion of married life
which Hipponax expresses in
the following lines δύ’ ήαέραι
’γυναικός εἰσιν ἥδισται, Ὀταν
’γαμῇ τις κάκφέρῃ τεθνηκυῖαν.
Another sentence of the same
kind is reported of Chaeremon
’γυναῖκα θάπτειν κρεῖσσόν ἐστιν ἦ
Ἱαμειν.

157. The reading of this
line is very uncertain. In the
reading adopted in our text we
have the final syllable in yram-
dior long (see Introd. p. 14),
and the last syssable in mulieris
as anceps, which in the caesura
may be excused.—aetas media,
i.e. inter senem iuvenemque, sed
propior se‘nz', as Seneca expresses
it Oed. 776. aetatis mediae mu-
zier Phaedr. 11 2, 3, the same

personbeingsubsequentlystyled
anus (10). Cicero has media
aetas de sen. 17, 60 and 20,
76.

159. nevis is a reading not
absolutely certain in this place,
and it is possible that Plautus
wrote the common non vis.
See Ritschl, Opusc. 11 249.
But in support of our reading
we may quote the analogous
passage, Poen. v 2, 119, at te
moneri num nevis? See, how-
ever, 8150 Most. 336.

161. Megadorus contemptu-
ously calls a wife of somewhat
maturer years anns, to express
that she is nearly old enough
to deserve this title. The epi·
thets senex and anus are, how-
ever, not to be taken as expres-
sive of a very old age, as
they are sometimes applied to
persons of about 45 to 50 years.
E. g. Amphitruo is styled se-
nex in the comedy bearing his
name v 1, 20, and Π 2, 12,
though he seems a newly-
married man in the prime of his
years.
