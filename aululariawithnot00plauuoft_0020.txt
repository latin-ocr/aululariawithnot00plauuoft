16 INTRODUOTION.

junctive (both present and imperfect)¹. The ending et
os the future belongs, of course, to the same series².

Nay, even the suffix it in the present of the so—called
third conj ugation was originally long, 6. g. Plautus has per-
cipit Men. 921, and Ennius ponit (Ann. 484). Hence we
should not be surprised to find similar unusual long vowels
in Horace (αφῐι Serui. 11 3, 260. figit Od. 111 24, 5. defendit
Serm. 1 4, 82) and in Virgil (sinit Aen. x 433. facit Ecl.
V11 23. petit Aen. lx 9). An explanation of this quantity
is given by Corssen, 11 492 : it will at once be understood

- by comparing the Latin and Greek forms of λέγω and

Ieyo:
λέγω Zeyo
λεγεις Zegfls or lessez‘s [eiz ἶ]3
λεγει(τ) ἰεῃῖύ 01 leqeit.

established by many inst 111065 111 Plautus and Terence⁵ ‚to

¹ 1 may quote an instance of
this quantity from thePseudulus,
v. 58:
cum e6 simul me mitteret. ei

rei dies.
In this line, Bitschl and Fleck-
eisen insert leno after me and
consider simul to be monosyl-
labic. This word seems how-
ever not indispensably neces-
sary, and I am inclined to read
the words in accordance with
the mss. Prof. Sauppe proposes
to read. cum eo‘ simitu mitterer
(ind. schol„ Gott. 18-2? p. 4).

VVherever archaic quantities
occur in the later poets, they
should be considered as the re-
sult of imitation of the earlier
writers. We may add that the
original long quantities are ad-
mitted by the later poets quite
exclusively in arsi, i. 6. when
the metrical accent falls upon
the ending 111 question.
