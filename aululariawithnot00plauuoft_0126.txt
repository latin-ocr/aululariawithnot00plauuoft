passage& in which this con-
struction occurs, have been col-
lected by Brix in his note on
Men. 985.

345. For putens comp. v.
363. I do not find any other
passages where this kind of
punishment for slaves is men-
tioned. In Greek the eorre-
sponding word λάκκος means
also a kind of cellar.

346. The construction of the
words is quippe qui ubi nihil
est quod subrupias. For quippe
qui with a following indicative
see Key, L. Gr. ξ 1194 note.
qui in this connexion is an
archaic asseverative particle,
which in later language is only
known in the compound atqui.
For instances see Rud. 384.

ut qui in several instances which

have perversely been corrected
by the editors: As. 505. Trin.

See Fleckeisen, Krit. Miscellen.
p. 32 s.

347. For subrupias see note
on v. 39. -

348. For qui as a direct in-
terrogative see Madvig, ἓ 88, 1.

351. The active infinitive
mittere is defended in note on
v. 242.

352. In the festivals called
Cereris nuptiae the use of wine
was not permitted: see Servius
on Verg. Georg. 1 344 and Ma-
crobius, Saturn. 111 11. The
original significance of these
festivals is not quite evident;
Preller (rom. Mynh. p. 439)
thinks that they commemorated
the wedding of Pluto and Pro-
serpina, at which Ceres was
conceived in the character of
hostess.
