unde e'xeuntem me aspexistis. hanc domum

iam multos annos est quom possideo 01 0010 7
patrique avoque iam 11111115 qui nunc hic habet ·

activity is displayed in field and
garden, on roads and in path-
ivays, in town and hamlet, 011
1110 vault of heaven and in the
deep of the sea, as is proved by
the epithets given to them; but
above all they are held to be
the benevolent and helpful
spirits of the clear homestead
and house, the genial blessing
of whom pervades the whole
family, and makes it thrive
(Preller, Ro'm. Mythol. p. 71 sq.
486 sq. 2nd ed). The name is
in Etruscan Las-(1, in Latin
Las-es, Lar-es, (Lar-a, Lar-
unda ‘the mother of the Lares ')
and has been justly derived
from the root las ‘to desire 01·
wish,’ whence we have in Latin
las-c-ivu-s‚ in Gothic Ζιιε-ΐιι-ε,
Old High Germ. Ius-ti, ‘lust'
Las-a, Las-es, Lar-es would
thus mean ‘well-wishing, be-
nevolent' spirits like the H 0ἶάοη
in German mythology.”co1·ssen‚
Etrusker, 1 p. 246. See also
our note on Trin. 39.

4. The construction of this
line is somewhat negligent,
though used by Plautus himself
in another passage: Persa 137,
sicut istic Zeno handum sex
mensis Megaribus huc est quom
commigravit. Hence may have
arisen the French way of expres-
sing the same thought3 il vl a
beaucoup danne‘es que —. For

531110 way as in Virgil's expres-
sion nemorum cultrix Latonia

meant.

according to an idiom which
is pretty frequent in Plautus.

7. thensaurus is the genuine
Plautino form which, in conse-
quence of the thin pronuncia-
tion of the letter n, afterwards
became thesaurus. In the same
way we have Μεῃαῐεηεὶα--Με-

known to allz' 500 1)1·” ¹iger,

It is very natmal that clam
should goveni the accusative
in early Latin, as it is an ad-
verb formed from the root cal
seen in Greek καλ- ύπτω and
Καλ- υψώ, and 1135 originally
culam (comp. palam).
