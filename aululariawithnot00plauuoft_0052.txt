44 INTRODUCTION.

Φ- = Φ ν. We shall now consider 'ohe accent in its in-
fluence on the un-accented syllables of polysyllabis: words.

In was ‘che general tendency of the Latin language
of these times to lcum-ys over the zan-acceozted parts of
Zonqer words, ον of metrical compleoees of words, in order
to lay all tlte stress on that syllable which was rendered
prominent by the accent. But. even here a long syllable
could nob be shortened unless preceded by another short
syllable, i. e. only original iambs were changed into
pyrrhichs.

In a formula this may be expressed as follows
v—‡ = ν v L. This will be examined in detail and ex-
emplified in the following remarks.

We first, propose to consider such cases as actually
fall under this head, though the shortening process was
probably assisted by some secondary circumstances.

Many seeming violations of prosocly will be explained
by the fact that doublecl consonante* were unknown in
I’lautzcs’ time, they being] first introduced into the Latin
lavgyuaye by Ennius& Thus We find that in many
instances ll does not affeci] the quantity of ’che preceding
vowel, e. g.

According to a passage of Pliny, preserved by Pris-
cian Ι 38 ‘l exilem sonum habet, quando geminatur
secundo loco posita, ut, ille, Metellus) This was the
reason why in many names ending in lius the l was
