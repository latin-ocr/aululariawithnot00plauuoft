AVLVLARIA.

[iv. 8. 2—9.

ego sum ille rex Philippus. o lepidum diem.

nam ut dudum binc abii, mfflto illo adveni prior, 5
multoque prius me conlocavi in arborem,

indeque observabam, ubi aurum abstrudebat senex.

beliefs current among 1113 own
countrymen with regard to the
woodpeeker. The aurei montes
of the pici appeax only in this
0116 passage. I may venture to
· draw the attention of my readers
to another passage in Plautus,
without myselt' deducing any
hasty conclusion from it: Stich.
24 Persarum montis qui esse
aurei perhibentur, a passage
which may be compared with
some lines from Varro’s satire
'AvOpwwovpfyia(1). ‘264 ed. Bip.)
Persarum, montes, non divitis
atria Crassi.—For the form os
attraction noticeable in the pre·
sent h'ne, comp. note 011 v. 566,
and cf. also Ter. Eun. 1v 3, 11
Eunuchum quem dedisti nobis,
quas turbas cicilia—colunt ‘in-
habit ε’ 366 011 v. 4.

694. The joy 111 which Stro-
bilus is makes his words some-
what incoherent. He says ‘reyes
ceteros, though he has not yet
mentioned the name of any
king whose wealth might be
compared to 1113. This has al-
ready been pointed out by Lam-
binus—We may not think here
of kiny Picus (Preller, Rom.
Myth. p. 331 ss.) because we
have Pici in the plural.—istos
‘ those commonly admired.'

695. Nonius is undoubtedly
wrong in using the word mendi-

catio for the explanation of
mendicabulum.- the passage it-
sels shows that we should trans-
late ‘beggarly fellows.’ Appu-
leius has the same expression
in two passages, and in both 116
applies it to persons.-—F or the
hiatus see Introd. p. 67. The
emendation reyum mendicabula
(‘beggarly kinglets’)‚ which is
found 'm Guyet's text, seems
due to Scipio Gentilis (whoever
that worthy may have been),
as appears from Taubmann’s
note.

696. ille ‘the renowned.' See
note 011 v. 86.

698. The construction con-
locare in aliquid is not classic,
though by no means scarce.
See the dictionaries 3.1’. Men.
9862'12 tabernam vasa et servos
conlocavi. Plautus has also
ponere in aliquid, e. g. Trin.
739. Rud. 1v 7, 11.

699. For indeque see Introd.
p 700. In deorsum the e is to
be elided before the o.- see In-
trod. p. 65.

701. The form exfodio occurs
again in the best mss. in Mil.
gl. 315. The common Plautine
form is ecfodio (v. 63). ΕΠΟ-
