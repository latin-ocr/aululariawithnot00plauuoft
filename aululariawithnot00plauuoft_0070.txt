62 INTRODUCTION.

where we have deizcli even in common Latin¹‚ but in
the comio writers we find deo (Plaut. Cist. 1 3, 2. Liv.
Andr. trag. Ribb. v. 9)and deosfflaev. com. Ribb. 95. Plaut.
Amph. 1 1,128. 11 2, 86. v 1, 38. 41. Aul. 1v10, 12. 13.
Capt. 111 5, 69. Cui-c. 1 1, 70. 11 2, 13. v 2, 58. Cas.
11 5, 28. 38. 11 6, 37. 44. Cist. 11 3, 52, 1v 1, 12.
Epid. 11 2, 117. V 1, 4 and in many other passages) as
monosyllables2. The genitive dei occurs with a monosyl-
labio pronunciation only once, Ribb. Trag. p. 2025 deae
follows this analogy (Aul. 778. Cas. 11 4, 1. Cist. 11 1,

-35. Epid. 111 3, 15. Most. 1 3, 35. Pseud. 1 1, 35. 1 3, 36.

Poen. 111 3, 54. 1v 2, 37. v 4, 102. Persa 11 4, 21. 25.
27. V 2, 50). In the same way deorum is disyllabic in
many instances (Amph. prol. 45. Epid. v 2, 10. Bacch.
124. Men. 217. Rud. 11 2, 13). This fact may be com-
pared with the similar contr-acted pronunciation of θεὸς
and θεά, which is not unfrcquently met with in the tragic
mets.

Ι The word meus was treated much in the same way as
deus: we have therefore mei meae meo meos meas mei-3
sometimes as monosyllables, and meorum mearum meapte
(Truc. 11 5, 18) as disyllables³. The real pronunciation
of these forms in such cases may be ascertained from the
spelling mieis (z meis) which occurs in the dactylic in-
scription on the sepulchre of one of the Scipios: this
enables us to guess that it was probably very much like
the modern Greek pronunciation of θιὸς (— θεός), i.e. mst
dyo, etc.

Many forms of' the pronouns is and idem fall under
the same head3 thus we have ἔθ’ εἶ effidem &celem e—as
easdem &pse (Cure. 1 3, 4) ἷόε &salem {cie &aedem ἴα,
{Edem (abl.) ffirzcm. The subjunctives &imus ffitis appear
as disyllables according to the same rule, and in eme—andum
(Aul. 40) we notice the same pronunciation. We may
add ᾶηι Cist. 1 1, 39. Poen. 1 2, 117, and perhaps also

queo Aul. 190.
