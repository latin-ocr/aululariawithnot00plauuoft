lNTRODUOTION. 33

quid ego agam? pater iam hic me offendet miserum adve-

niens ebrium.
Most. 378 (according to the mss.)

pater venit. sed quid pertimui autem, belua.
Ter. Phorm. 601.

Ι11 these cases Prof. Key adopts a monosyllabic pronuncia-
tion: Fr. pere. The possibility of such a pronunciation is
questioned by Ritschl (Proll. Trin. CLV) whose words are
as follows: ‘In quibus (i.e. monosyllabis) si etiam pater
habitum est, eius rei et rationem et documenta desidero.
et omnium minime ex eo argumentandum esse quod, ut e
soror monosyllabum soeur, ita e pater similiter factum
esse pere dicunt, vel 111116 intelligitur quod, etsi frere
quoque et mere e fmter et mater contracta sunt, tamen
haec latina nec contendit quisquam nec poterit contendere
unquam monosyllaba fuisse? This is, indeed, the best
argument¹ which can be alleged against Prof. Key's way
of pronouncing and contracting Latin words according to
the analogy of the corresponding F rench forms 3 but has
it been understood and appreciated by Mr Parry‘l This

1 Ι have left this passage ex-
actly as it was written ten years
ago, In his work on ‘Language‚’
p. 133, Mr Key alludes to the
above as follows—‘ In parricida
for patricida we see already that
change which led to the Fr.
pcre from pater ; and. here again
when pater appears in Latin
comedy, as it sometimes does, to
need a shortened pronunciation‚
it seems simpler to drop 1116 t
than to drop the r, as Dr Wag-
ner proposes. Of course mater
and srdcer, with their long pen-
11113, were better able for a
time to resist such com pressiori,
so that Ritschl’s contentiori has
Ι think little weight! This is a
remarkable instance of perverse
argumentation. Mr Key appa-
rently assumes a form some-
what resembling paer, to be

W. P.

pronounced like the Fr. pere.
But pere is not, as he thinks,
descended from pater, but from
patrem, comp. the Italian padre,
and see e. g. Brachet‚ Dict.
etym. de la langue franc. p. 404.
It is evident that pere :patre(m)
cannot represent pater. But
what weight shall we attribute
to the assertion of a modern
writer of the 19111 century that
he considers this or that pro-
nunciation to be ‘ simpler,'
when this is quite contrary to
the very evidence of the 111-
scriptions and earliest mss?
See 1116 instances collected by
Schuchardt, On Vulgar Latin
11 390 sq., where both pate and
soro are quoted from ancient
testimony.—See also Corssen 11
