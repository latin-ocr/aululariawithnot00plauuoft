46 INTRonuc'ron.

In the same way, the word satellites should be read
scitelites in a line of the Trinummus (833).
mm does not lengthen the first syllable in the word

immo, which Plautus himself would have spelt inw:
see Mero. 737, Caec. Ribb. com. p. 47, Ter. Phorm. 936,

Hec. 437. 726. 877¹.

ἠιη fall under the same rule, as the following instance

shows :

per annonam caram dixit me natum pater.

Stich. 179.

This is the reading of all the mss, including the old
Ambrosian3 Ritschl has per caram annonam, in accord-
31100 with a conjecture of Bothe ².—As there was in the
original pronunciation of the Romans no difference
between mn and nn3, we find the first syllable in omnis
treated as short in several passages 111 Plautus&

pp does not differ prosodiacally from a single p in
the word Philippus, which in Plautus almost invariably
appears with the Greek accentuation Φίλιππος ΡΙιὶἶΞρῑωὶ

instance, see Corssen, 11 663 sq.
—Brix compares (ed. of the
Trin. naehtr. p. 113) 1110 spel-
ling sacilumed in the SC. de
Bacanalibus.—All those scho-
lars who believe in an entire
harmony between the natural
and metrical accent in the versi—
fication of the comio poets can-
not of course credit the short
quantity of the second syllable
in simillumae. They will con-
sequently save the long quan-
tity by pronouncing smillumae.
We believe, on 1110 contrary,
that in this one passage the
syllable in question was rhythm-
ically shortened, and we may
compare the analogous case of
εᾱῃὶία, which will be mentioned
hereafter.

1 See O. Ribbeck, Com. fragm.
Coroll. ed. sec. p. xxiv. So far
as our mss, are concerned‚ the

spelling immo is generally sup-
ported by better authorities than
zmo.

2 See also Mffller, Ρ1ο5. p.
289.

3 Comp. solennis and sollem-
nis, and the Italian forms alun-
no colonna dannare = alumnus
columna damnare ,· in Italian
οῃηί stands for onni.

4 See Aul. 598. Trin. 78.
Other examples are found in
Bitschl's Proll. cxxxn. 55.

⁵ Ritsaffl, Proll. Lxxxnx.
cxxxn. Scaliger's statement on
the quantity of Philippus ‘et
numquam aliter invenies apud
Plautum quin mediam corri-
puerit’ 15 not accurate. The
Plautine spelling of this name
was Pilipus, just as we find it
on a coin of the year 620: see
C. Ι. L. 1 354.
