PROLOGVS. ’79

10 nunquam indicare id silio voluit suo,

inopemque optavit potius eum relinquere
quam eum thensaurum commonstraret. fssio
agri reliquit ei non magnum modum,

quo cum labore magno et misere viveret.

15 ubi is 6biit mortem qui mi id aurum credidit,

coepi observare, ecqui maiorem filius

mihi honorem haberet quam eius habuisset pater.
atque ille vero minus minusque impendio

curare minusque me impertire honoribus.

20 item a me contra factumst: nam item obiit diem.

is hunc reliquit qui hic nunc habitat filium
pariter moratum, ut pater avosque eius fuit.
huic filia unast: ea mihi cotidie

prol. 1) observes that quoniam
is here used in its original sense
of a temporal conjunctim, being
but a compound of quom and
iam. Plautus has it so not un-
frequently, eg. Trin. 112 quo-
niam hinc iturust ipsus in Seleu-
ciam. ibid. 149 quoniam hinc
profectust ire per-eme Charmi-
des. We may observe the same
change of the two notions of
temporality and causality in
the German conJ. weil, which
has now almost entirely lost
its temporal sense, though this
was the original one. Never-
theless‚ Schiller uses it as an
equivalent to the English while,
wilhelm Tell, act 1 sc, 2 ‘weil
ich ferne bin, fiihre du mit
klugem sinne das regiment des
hauses.⁷ See also my note on
Trin. 14.—The words ita avido
ingenio fuit might stand in
brackets, at least they do not
influence the construction of
the sentence: ‘when he was
about to die, he did not—such
was his avaricious disposition—
reveal the secret to his son.'
10. id here and v. 8 denotes

the secret in general, and should
not be referred to thensaurus,
though a gloss in a Vienna
ms. suggests ‘nota thesaurum
neutro ρεπεν-ε clici) But in the
present prologue it is doubtless
masculine, see v. 12, and such
it is indeed wherever it occurs
in Plautus. For the indefinite
and somewhat loose employ-
ment of the neuter pronoun
the student may consult my
note on Trin. 405.

13. Comp. Hor. Serm. 11
6, 1 hoc erat in votis: modus
(ιφ-ἰ’ ‘non ita maynus.

18. impendio is here used
as an adverb. Cicero has it
so in his epistles‚ ad Att. x 4, 9
at ille impendio nunc mayis odit
senatum. See Afranius 351 {71—
dies impendio Ι esc desiderio ‘mci—
9is manisque maceror, and Ter.
Eun. 587 impendio magis αηί-
mus yaudebat mihi. In later
latin1ty, e. g. in Appuleius and
Ammianus Marcellinus‚we meet
with the same adverbia] use of
impendio.
