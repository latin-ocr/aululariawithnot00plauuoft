senex obsonari filiai nuptiis?

282. operam (labo ‘I will
hold myself ready for your ser-
vice)

283. popli instead of populi .·
comp. Lorenz on Most. 15, who
shows that Plautus employs the
shorter form only at the end of
a hue or before the principal
caesura.

284. Anthrax, the other eook
who seems more honest but less
witty than Congrio, catches at
Congrio's expression hic tam
palam, and calls him therefore
pudicum prostibulum, adding as
his suspicion that Congriowould
perhaps not refuse to yield to
such a proposaL if made at a
fitter time and place—haud
nolles, an intensifying λιτότης
for velles ‘you would be quite
ready! (See Ritscln Opusc. 11
250.)

285. Congrio replies that he
meant operam dare v. 282 in a
different sense, not obscenely
as Anthrax would insinuate.—
aliovorsum dicere: comp. Ter.
Eun. 1 2, 2 aliorsum accipere.

286. istuc is here adverb:
istoc, see Key, L. G. ἓ 366.-
Strobilus intends to avoid all
further quarrel and says there-
fore sed crus dcc. ‘but to come
to the point, my master is going
to marry.’ For this usage of
secl see Zumpt ἕ 739.

288. huius is here monosyl-
labic=huis, see Introd. p. 63,
note 3.

291. ‘Do you mean to say
that you are going to send one
half here, the other to your own
house?

292. nempe has its first syl-
lable short: see Introd. p. 51.

293. The same expression

filiai nuptiis occurs v. 370. 532.

790. In these three passages
the mss. rightly omit in, which
must be omitted, since the final
i in filiai cannot be elided:
comp. Lachmann, Lucr. p. 161.
In this passage we are at liberty
to take nuptiis either as a da-
tive or an ablative (see Key, L.
G.§ 992. Zumpt ξ 475), but in
others it must be ablative.
