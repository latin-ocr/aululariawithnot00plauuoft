In the passive, the shortening propensities of the
Latin language displayed themselves chiefly in the first
person of the singular. In Plautus we find sometimes
the original quantities ὃν· (12³, nay fer-<ir is met with
as late as Ovid (Met. V11 61). Analogously‚ the endings
er and ‘rer in the subj. were originally long.

It may finally be remarked that es (‘thou art’) is
invariably long in the prosody of the comio poets.

B. IRREGULAR SHORTENING OF LONG FINAL vowssLs.

All these long vowels are, however, of but occasional
occurrence in Plautus and Terence—they are, indeed,
nothing more than a few seattered remnants of a period of
the language‚ which was rapidly waning and dying away.
The qeneral character of the language in the time of
Plautus was quite different. A destructive element had
already commenced its powerful influence upon the lan-
guage, and had already deeply affected and altered the
original quantity of many endings and even of many
1·ootvowels of Latin words.

The accent in Latin never falls on the last syllable,
and its tendency was to destroy the length of this last
syllable³‚ especially in ease the word was disyllabic and
had a short penult.
