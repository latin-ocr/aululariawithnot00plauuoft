embarrassment to his rcader. But then again, Plautus
composed his dramas for oral recitation‚ and not for

the common usage of the Augustan period:

and in many cases 111 Greek. That it must have been
so, might, even in default of other proofs, have been con-
cluded from the simple fact that the genitive ᾶῐ would be
left unaccounted for, but for the length of the nom. a
(ffitschl, Rhein. Mus. XIV' 400). But we actually find it
long in three lines of the old inscriptions on the sepulchres
of the Scipios.

(Ritschl, ibid.) Nay, Biicheler shows (jalcrbiicherfdr clas-
sische philolo-(sie 1863 p. 336 s.) that in all the Saturnians
which have come down to us, the 110111. and voc. (ι is con-
stantly long. We find it long again in some lines of Livius
Andronicus, Naevius and Ennius (Anu. 148. 484. 319.
433. 305 ed. Vahlen), and in a hexameter in the sepul-
chral inscription which Plautus is said to have composed
for himself:

scaenast de'sertci: dein Risus Ludu’ Iocusque.

It is therefore by no means sui-prising to find that Plautus
uses the same quantity in several passages of his come-
dies. This fact had already been acknowledged by Linde-
mann in Trin. 2512, and in about a dozen passages by
