Roman way of abbreviating the word: mo (‘Alphabet'

orthographical representation of a word, nothing is prima

other argument is drawn from the Romance languages,
where quomodo appears in the shape of como come comme:
it would, no doubt, prove that quomodo really sounded
like quomo (como) in the latest period of the Latin

recognise in Plautine prosody the beginnings and the
first gei-ms of a depravation of the Latin lauguage, which
attained its final development in the Romance languages.
We need not, therefore, hesitate to explain Romance
forms from such shortened endings as are found in
Plautus, but great cantion should be used in remodelling
the pronunciation of Plautine forms upon the analogy of
Romance corruptions. The spirit of modern philology
requires that the order of time should be observed and
forbids us to blend the peculi-arities of the different
periods of any language2. If, however, any further proof

all be repudiated by the actual
pronunciation of those students
themselves.
