14 INTRODUCTION.

This quantity admits of an easy explanation. The Latin
suffix bus corresponds to the Sanskr. bhyas, and would
appear to have been long by way of contraction, and
indeed the long quantity remained for ever in nobis and
vobis, in which bis is the same suffix as bus (Corssen 1
169. 11 49, and chiefly p. 498 sq., where the Plautine
instances are discussed). virgil, Aen. IV 64, has pec—
toribzls inhians, in seeming imitation of the archaic pro-
sody : see Nettleship in Conington’s Vix-gil 111 p. 468.

The ending οφ· in nouus of the third declension is
frequently long. That it was originally long, might
readily be concluded from the genitive ὂνὶε· and from a
comparison with the Greek ωρ. Thus we have soro‘r
Pocn. Ι 2, 29. 151. 194. IV 2, 73. Epid. v 1, 50. Bacch.
1140. zcoe5r Stich. 140. As. 927. The same is the case
with the comparatives stultior Bacch. 123, αῖισίίῦν Capt.
782, Ζοηςχὶὅγ· Amph. 548, vorsuti& Epid. 111 2, 35¹. It
seems, therefore, but natural that we should find the
neuter lonqias Men. 327, on which passages Brix's note
may be compared. O. F. W. Muller, Pros. p. 55—57,
alters the passage quoted in support of this quantity:
Wrongly, as we think. (Jomp. also Bucheler's treatise on
Latin Declension, p. 4. Corssen 11 500. 507.

Poen. v 5, 15. It has the same quantity in three passages
in Virgil, Aen. v 521. ΧΙ 469. XII 14. (Nettleship ap.
Conington, 111 467.) The fact is accounted for by Prof.
Key, Lat. Grani. p. 437. Phil. Essays p. 86. But I have
now yielded to Corssen⁷s objections 11 502 sq. and corrected
these two passages.
