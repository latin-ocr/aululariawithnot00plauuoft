STROBILvs (II)

IV. 1

Hoc est servi facinus frugi, facere quod ego per-

sequor :

580 ne morae molestiaeque imperium erile habeat sibi.

nam qui ero ex sententia servire servos postulat,

in erum matura, in se sera condecet capessere.

sin dormitet, ita dormitet, servom sese ut cogitet: 5
[nam qui amanti ero servitutem servit, quasi ego

servio,

One of the greatest difficulties
in the Aulularia consists in the
name and character of the slave
Strobilus who makes his ap-
pearance in the first scene of
thjs act. That the Strobilus of
the first scene of the third act
cannot be the same person with
this, may be readily perceived ;
nor is it easy to believe that
Plautus would have designated

’ two different characters by one

and the same name. The most
probable assumption is that the
two characters, that of the slave
of Megaronides and that of
Lyconides' servant, were acted
by one and the same performer,
whence they were subsequently
thrown together under one
name. It is idle to speculato
what may have been the origi-
nal name of the second Strobi-
lus, but it is certain that he is
a very different person from the
Strobilus of the first three acts
of our play. We should ob-

serve that, like his slave, Mega-
dorus has now disappeared from
the scene of action, and that
Lyconides now steps forward.

579. facinus would in prose
be generally omitted ; translate
‘it behoves a good servant)—
From Cicero Tusc. 111 8, 16 we
leam that the Greek for frugyi
would be χρήσιμος, and the
same writer informs us that
hominem fruffi omnia recte. sa-
cere, iam proverbi locum obtinet
ib. 1v 16, 36.

581. ex sententia ‘to his
satisfaction’; for the phrase see
note on Ter. Haut. tim. 1v 3,
5.—postulat:volt, ἀξιοῖ, see on
359.

observed (de Aul. p. 29) that
the reading of these lines could
not be genuine, and had thought
of transposing 591—594 after
