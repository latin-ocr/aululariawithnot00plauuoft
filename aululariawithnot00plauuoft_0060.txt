to which Crain (Plaut. Stud. p. 16) adds a line from the
Mostellaria (509):

viv6m me accersunt ad Rchenmtem m6rtui.

We have here four instances of a rhythmical shorten-

. ing of a vowel which is 111 all other instances long. That

this same vowel is always short in the usage of later
poets, is no doubt (lue to the adoption of the quantity of
the Greek word¹.

The two genitives eius and lanius are occasionally
shortened in their first syllable, when standing after a
short accented syllable²:

ut sibi eius faciat c6piam. illa enim se negat.
Ter. Phorm. 113.

si quid huius simile 16116 aliquando evenerit.
Ter. Haut. tim. 551.

Mr Pari-y gives in the first instance sibi ut eius, while
he preserves the reading of the mss. in the second pas-
sage, where it would have been just as easy to transpose
si lulius quid. But thele is no note on either passage
to enlighten the reader about such a surprising incon-
sistency.

To this shortened quantity in the genitive we may
add an instance in which the dative huic has the metrical

value ofa shoit syllable: Ter. Ad. 11 5, 4 (= 638 Fla>
quid huic hic negotist? tune has pepulisti foris?

This is, as far as I can see, the reading of all mss.
and editions, but no editor has a note on the shortened
quantity of huic. Guyet alone <Comm. p. 244) proposes
to write quid laic huic.
