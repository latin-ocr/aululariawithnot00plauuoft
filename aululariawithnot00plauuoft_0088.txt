sibi uxorem poscat: id ea faciam gratia
quo ille earn facilius ducat qui compresserat.

et hic qui poscet eam sibi uxorem senex,
is adulescentis illiust avonculus,

qui illam stupravit noctu, Cereris vigiliis.
sed hic senex iam clamat intus, ut solet.

tidie, is a form well supported
by the best mss. and expressly
recommended by Marius Victo-
rinus 1 p. 2460 <Pius-ch).

24. tus vinum coronae were
the usual honours offered to
the household-gods : see v. 383
and the commentators upon
Hor. Od. 111 23, 3. Iuv. lx 137
ss.

25. Comp. huius honoris yra-
tia Amph. 1 2, 24.

27. After having given the
(leneral reason of his aetion, the
Lar is now going to inform his
hearers of the ‹letailed circum-
stances. This is the true ex-
planation of vam, a particle
which never gives up its cha-
racter entirely, though it may
seem simply connective in some
passages. The Greek ’γάρ is
often used in exactly the same
way. See note on v. 595.

29. neque autem (⁸n0r on
the other hand’) is used by
Cicero Fam. v 12 and Lucretius
1 857, and VI 779.

30. hic senex de proxumo (ex
prox. 169. 288) ‘the old man,

our neighbour.⁷ He means Me-
gadorus

31. For sibi ἅτθ’ῌ see Introd.
p. 49. In 33 the word uxor
has its original quantity.

35. Cereris vigyiliis] Lyconi-
des himself confesses this fact
to Euclio v. 787 S. ‘ The noc-
tiunal festival of Ceres, θεσμο-
φόρια, υἱῃίἷίαε Cereris, used to
be celebrated by married and
unmarried women strolling a-
bout in the dark without lights,
whence this opportunity could
easily be misused by young
men desirous to encounter ro-
mantio adventures. The comic
poets are therefore quite true to
reality 111 founding the plots of
some of their plays upon these
festivals, as e. g. Plautus does
here and in his Cistellaria
(where see the prol. 8).' ΚῦΡΚΕ.
Cicero has several Chapters
against such licentious festi-
vals as these 111 his second
book de legibus, where he es-
pecially mentions their frequent
occurrence in the comic poets,
