56 INTRODUOTION.

Both instances have been altered by Fleckeisen and
Ritschl, but the reading of the mss. is defended by
Geppert, lat. ausspr. p. 93 (Corssen, 11 660).

Prof. Key, in his ‘Miscellaneous Remarks on Ritschl's
Pla-utus‚' p. 195, justly observes that this pronunciation
of dedisti (desisti, desti), dedistis and other derivations
gave rise to the contracted forms of this verb which we
find in Italian (desti desta diero), Spanish (eliste disces
dier-on diem delesse), and Portuguese (desta desces clera
desse). Stfll, I must differ from Prof. Key when he
applies the same contracted pronunciation to the verses
of the ancient comio poets themselves: it may here be
repeated for the last time that the application of late and
modern forms to an entirely distant period seems to vio—
late the laws of historical philology 3 we are, therefore,
entitled to recognise the working power and the first
germs of Roniance forms in the shortened forms of
Plautine prosody, but we should not use the final stage
of any historical development, as an explanation of the
remote cause which first originated it. What would
be the result if we were to explain Anglo-Saxon forms
from modern English corruptions²2
