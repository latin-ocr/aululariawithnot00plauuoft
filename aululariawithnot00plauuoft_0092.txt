84 AVLVLARIA.

[1. 1. 12—18.

potius quidem, quam hoc pacto apud te se'rviam.
EV. at {it scelesta sola secum murmurat.

oculo's hercle ego istos, improba, ecfodiam tibi,

ne me observare possis, quid rerum geram. 15

55 abscede etiam nunc, etiam nunc.

Ev. ohe,

ST. etiamne 2

istic astato. si hercle tu ex istoc loco
digitum transvorsum aut i'mguem latum excesseris,

faxim, see Neue 11 pp. 539.
543—546. A third formation
of the same kind is capsim
capsis, which was misunder-
stood for cape sis (εἰ vis) by
Cicero Or. 45, 154 (an explana-
tion rejected by Quintilian 1 5,
66). The perfects ami (ay-si),
faxi (fac-si), cap-si follow the
analogy of duxi (duc-si) rep—si
etc.‚ while {olfeci cepi lengthen
the radical vowel. See Corssen,
Krit. Beitr. zur lat. Formenl. p.

52. Such alliterations as sce-
lesta sola secum are very fre-
quently found in the ancient
Roman poets and merit our
especial attention. We shall
here point out only a few ex-
amples which occur in the next
lines: dedam discipulam 59.
metuo male 61. miserum modis
66. miseram modum 69. decies
die 70. Alliteration was, it is
true, never a necessary and
organic element in Latin poetry,
at least so far as our sources
permit us to trace back its his-
tory; still, it was frequently
employed by the earliest poets
who kept close to the spoken
language of the people‚ which
:is always fond of alliteration3
and even in the so-called clas-
sical periods of Latin poetry it

v was often employed as an ad-

ditional ornament. Horace eg.
uses it very judiciously in such
passage. as dulce decus Od. 1 1,
2. dulce et decorum 1 1 2, 13.
dulce docta 111 9, 10. dulci
distinet a domo 1v 5, 12 etc.
See a very good essay on this
subject in Lucian Miiller's

book de re metr. poet. p. 450 ι

ss‚ and Mr Munro's remarks in
his edition of Luc-retius 11 p.

53. For examples of the
phrase oculos ecfodere (ὀφθαλ-
μοὺς ἐξορύσσςιν) See Aul. 187.
Capt. 111 1, 4. Trin. 463. Ter.
Eun. 1v 6, 2, where Donatus
observes ‘femineae minae szmt.'

54. The phrase quid rerum
{leram is not unfrequently met
with in Plautus; thus we have
it again Aul. 117.

57. Gronovius Lect. Pl. p.
48 sq.‚ quotes the expression
diyicas transversus from Cato
de re rust. c. 45 and 48, and
the equivalent patens dlyitus
is quoted from Caes. b. e. 11 10.
unquis transversus occurs in two
passages of Cicero's, ad Att.
x111 20 and Fam. vn 25. In
the latter passage the addition
of the words quod aiunt shows
the proverbial character of the

expression, which would how· ⁴

ever be perfectly evident even
without this hint.
