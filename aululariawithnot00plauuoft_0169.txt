741. In this line we are in-
debted to Nonius for preserving
the genuine phrase luci claro,
which is generally obliterated
in our mss. Comp. Ter. Ad. v
3, 55 cum primo luci, where the
Bombinus has primo Iucu, while
prima luce is found in recent
mss. (see Bentley’s note): Do-
natus, whose notes are here
interpolated, has however a
genuine remark on this pas-
sage veteres masculino ,qenere
dicebant lucem-Flam. Cist. 11
1, 48 B gives quom primo luci
and the mss. of Nonius give the
same phrase in a line of Atta
468, 32=Ribb. Com. p. 138.
But in Cic. de off. 111 31, 112 all
the mss give cum prima luce.—
In a fable of Ennius rendered
in prose by Gellius 11 29 (Enn.
ed. Vahlen p. 160) we have
primo luce, which is the reading
of the cod. Reg. of Gronovius,
recent mss having prima luce.—
The phrase Luci claro is quoted
from Varro's Synephebus by
Nonius 210; see Vnum, Bip. ed.
p. 309.-1n general comp. Cha-
risius p. 203 ed. Keil. lucz·
(ag. Men. 1006) should be con-

W. P.

non attactam

sidered as an adverb like mani
heri (mane here) ; see Key, L. G.
ξ 784. It shows clearly that
these adverbs are originally ab·
latives, being construed with
adj. and prepositions. Comp.,
moreover, the phrase cum primo
mane in the Bell. Afr. c, 62.
cum luci simul Stich. 364.

743. ‘Love and wine are in-
deed extremely cheap things,
if a drunken hot-brained youth
be allowed to do anything
without fear of punishment.⁷
This is the plain sense of
the passage, though it was not
understood by Lambinus and
the other commentators. Hein-
sius even conjectured nimis
vtile, which is against the me-
tre.

747. For the construction
comp. Ter. Haut. tim. 11 3, 6
non oportuit relictas, 1v 1, 22 in-
teremptam oportuit ‘you should
have killed her.' Amph. 11 2,
108 comprecatam oportuit. In
such phrases Plautus common-
ly omits esse .- see Mil. gl. 1336.
Gist. 11 3, 41. Truc. 11 6, 29.
