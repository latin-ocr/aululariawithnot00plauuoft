34 INTRODUCTION.

scholar accuses Ritschl of ‘lesing sight of the difference
in quantity' between frater mater and pateo-¹. But
Bitschl’s argument is entirely based on this very same
difference. He means that, if we once begin to re-
model the old pronunciation of Latin upon that of the
French of the nineteenth century, we must be prepared
to find a conti-acted pronunciation of mater and frater
just as well as of pater, all these words being treated
alike in F rench as merc frere pere. But we never meet
in Plautus and Terence with mater or frater as mono-
syllables, οη account of their dejfferent quantity, and this

’ fact proves that, as we cannot draw a correct inference

from mere and fre‘re as to mater and frater, we cannot
consequently rely upon the com parison of pere and pater.
And indeed in Plautus or other poem, we never find mate
and fratezmater and frater, though in a Faliscan in-
scription we actually read MATEHEOUPA, i. e. mater
laic cubat? But this is of course a low dialectic cor-
ruption ³.

The same theory accounts sor the loss of a final t and
d. An old form lma (instead of haud) owes its existence
to this process (see note on v. 170): it remained in use
until the time of Tacitus, if we may trust the authority
of the Medicean ms. In the Aulularia we have apa
(zaput or apuam in several instanoes (v. 83. 340. 736.),
in the sanie we should pronounce

caput: capu 422. 423.

³ We need not add how dan-
gerouS, nay how fallacious, it
is to draw inferences from
French with regard to the pro-
nunciation of Latin. Ι do not
