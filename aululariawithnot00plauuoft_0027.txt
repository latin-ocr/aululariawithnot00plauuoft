INTRODUCTION. 23

In the comio poets, however, this ending is, generally
speaking, short¹.

i in the ablative of the third declension appears short-
ened in the anapaestic line from Plautus’ Bacchides 1108

igiti'n: pari fortuna, aetate ut sumus, fitimm· 2: sic est. sed tu.

This is the reading of the mss. adopted by Fleckeisen.
The i of the dative is shortened in cani .·

οέυῑ quoque etiam ademptumst nomen.-.
Epid. 11 2, 50.

Τ116 i of the nom. plur. appears short in meri :

meri bellatores glgnuntur, quas hic praef-inisti? flegit.
1 . g . 77.

u of the fourth is shortened in mmm Trin. 288. It
is the same with the e of the fifth, which is occasionally
found short, e. g. Poen. IV 2, 68 F ide* non melius creditur.
So also Mil. gl. 1369, sid& nulla &sse ce.

In the datives milei tibi sibi the final i was originally 1³- XXV
long and is still found so in Plautus and Terence, though
both have it also short. Even the usage of the lator
poets was never constant, and the i in these words was
always common². We have noticed this point in a pre-
vious place.

In the same way we find the genitive-ending i of the
second declension shortened in the words eri (zelomini)
Mil. gl. 362. viri Ter. Phorm. V 3, 4. boni Truc. ΙΙ 4, 78
(= 428 Gn), and ozovz ibid. 11 4, 32 (= 382 G..) preti Mil. gl.
1061. modi Poen. V 4, loa—malz (nom. plur.) occurs
Pseud. 142 (Fleck.)——the ι’ of the locative appears short-
