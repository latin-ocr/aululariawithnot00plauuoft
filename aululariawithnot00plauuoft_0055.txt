INTRODUCTION. 47

Probably, the short quantity of the second syllable is
to be attributed to the influence of the Greek accent-
uation: see Scaliger, Auson. Lect. lib. 11 21 (p. 147
ed. 1588). See also my note on Aul. 86.

ss has the metrical value of a single s in the verb
esse, which must often be read ἔθει. The same reason
explains the prosody of dechsse Amph. 11 2, 130², and
vicissatim Stich. 532³.

tt has the metrical value of a single t in sayita = sa- p. xliv.
qitta, Persa 25 ancl Aul. 393⁴. This prosody was first
pointed out by Kampmann‚ and after having been re-
jected by Ritschl (Proll. Trin. CXXIII), has lately been
revived by Fleckeisen (Krit. Miscellen‚ p. 39—42>.

cc = c in &ccasio (Persa. 268) &oculto (e. g. Trin. 712)
decumbe (Most. 308) and decepisti (eg. Trin. 964⁵).
In the words eccum eccam eccos eccas the first syllable

is frequently shortened.

dd would seem to be equal to a single d in adde
(Trin. 385) and redde (Stich. 786) ⁶.

² Corssen 11 647. The same
prosody occurs Cist. 1 3, 24.
Pseud. 893. Ritschl corrects the
passage of the Amphitruo in his
Prolegomena p. cxxv. Theline
of the Pseudulus should be
read: ndmen est : : scio icim tibi
me ‘recte dedisse epistulam, for
this is the reading of the mss.‚
the Ambrosian palimpsest not
being trustworthy in this pas-
sage. I am glad to see that
Fleckeisen does not adopt
Ritschl's conjectures in these
two passages,

³ n6s potius oneremus nosmet

vicissatim volfiptatibus.

‘This is the reading of the
mss, recommended by the al*-
literation ; it will no doubt be
acknowledged by Ritschl in a
second edition; Fleckeisen has

it in the text.’ Bccmzmm,
