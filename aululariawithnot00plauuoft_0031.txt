INTRODUCTION. 27

shortened final vowels in the prosody of the comio poets.
I have not quoted any instances from Terence, bnt may
be allowed to refer the reader to my Introduction-to the
Cambridge edition of 1869, p. 15 sq. I may also add
that Prof. Koy accounts for the apparent shortening of
the imperatives and other suffixes by treating these
words as monosyllables by way of contraction 3 see his
‘Language‚ etc.⁷ p. 470—473.

We shall now briefly enumerate other verba] endings
which appear short 111 Plautine prosody contrary to the
usage of the Augustan period.

An originally long z· was shortened in the passive
infinitive¹, eg. (ῖαγῑ (Plaut. Rud. 960. Ter. Ad. 311.
Phorm. 261), pati (Aul. 719), loqu& (Bacch. 1104): see
RitschI, Proll. CLXVIII. So also 017ιῖ Epid. 11 2, 116—a
line which is read in Geppert's edition in a sadly cor-
rupted state². The same took place in the perf. act. dedi
bib& steti, and even in adtuli (Aul. 430) and occidi (ib.
705)³.—0 was shortened in the first persons εὔ ay& υοῖὄ
scic? εἱηό neq& dabo 0νὸ cecla: in 1110 same way we have
iussero Aul. 439, which may be compared to (ἰίωονὸ Hor.
Serm. 1 4, 104. odeo-6 Ov. am. 111 11, 35. Other instances
of a shortened final o from later poets are given by

Hlssfognp. frui Anth. Lat. Mey.

² Thus we have veh& and
sequi in the ‘sortes Praenes-
tinae,’ a number of hexame-
ters composed in the popular
prosody: see Ritsehl, Rh. Mus.
xv p. 396. As thei (or ei) be-
came short, it could easily pass
into a simple e: thus we have
fiere in Ennius Ann. 15, a form
also given by the cod. Put. of
Livy XXVI 3, 13 in a solemn in-
terrogation of the plebs: see
H. A. Koch, Rh. Mus. XVI 120.

³ These are examples derived
from the so-called ‘free' metres.
Compare vici Anth. Lat. Mey.

1157, 7. fec't‘ ibid. 9. It is cu-
rious that the editor of the An-
thology denies the short quan-
tity of the final i in 1110 perf, in
another instance, 1165, 5 fini-

bus Italiac? monumentum vicii Vo-
ber-nae. A pentameter ends υἲκῐ
dies 1203, 13. But shortenings
like υἱεῖ fec} vixi would be in-
admissible in Plautine prosody,
as the original prosody of these
words is not iambic.
