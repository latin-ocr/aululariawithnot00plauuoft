68 INTRODUCTION.

Nor would Ι correct the ms. reading in v. 671

indeque 6bservabo, aurum ubi abstrudat senex.

We have the same hiatus v, 69 :

queo conminisci : ita me miseram ad hunc modum,

as the line stands not only in Jy and the recent mss,
but in B itself.

Another instance which may be alleged, is somewhat
doubtful. It is v. 504,

. stat fullo phrugio aurifex linarius.

In this case we may notice that B gives playflssqz’o, a
reading which might be supported by a great many analo-
gous examples of other words¹, though it is true that this
form of the word seems to occur nowhere else. If there-
fore we could confidently say that a hiatus was in this
line an impossibility, we should have to give plzurgyio in
our text.

But there is a general law which protects a great
many passages in Plautus, in which a hiatus occurs, from
the corrections of modern scholars. We owe its discovery
to Fleckeisen. It is as follows :

Blonosyllables terminaciny in α ἷοηῃ vowel or m need
not coalesce willa a· sollowz'ngy short vowel.

Illustrations of this law may be found in such pas-
sages as Stich. 321. Aul. 707. 708. Mil. gl. 13302.
