295. This was a proverbial
expression, comp. Persa 1 1, 41
aquam e pumice postulas qui
‘Ipsus sitiat and Pseud. 73 pumi-
cei ocule—For aridus see the
commentators on Ter. Haut.
tim. 111 2, 15 secl habet patrem
quendam avidam miserum. atque
aridam. It is frequently used
to denote the nature of the pu-
mice-stone, e. g. Catull. 1, 2.
Martial VIII 72. pumex is ge-
nerally a masculine, but some-
times we have it also as a femi-
nine, see Priscian VI 712 (R).
Servius on Aen. ΧΠ 587 ‘pumi-
cem autem iste (Vergilius) mas-
culino genere posuit, et himo
sequimur,· nam et Plautus ita
dixit’ seems to allude to this
passage in the Aulularia. We
should probably pronounce ar-
dus in the present passage, in
order to avoid an incorrect ana-
paest in the fourth foot of the
trimeter. ardus occurs in an
inscription, C. Ι. L. 1 577, 2, 21,
and was used by Lucilius. See
O. Seyffert Stud. Plaut. p. Γ».

296. tandem expresses Con-
grio’s unwillingness to believe
what Strobilus tells him. See
Zumpt ξ 237. The same in-
dignant question ain tandem
occurs Ter. Andr. 875. Phorm.

297. quin here and v. 300

W. P.

means ‘even : ’ see Zumpt ἓ 542.
If found with an indicative, this
particle is quite different in ori-
gin from quin c. coni. In the
latter case, it is a eompound of
the relative pronoun qui and
the original negation mn· in the
first, it is the interrogative qui
and ne. In translating it by
‘why‚' we may preserve its ori-
ginal meaning.

298. eraclicztrizusque abra-
dicibus (v. 248> perire: see the
commentators on Ter. Andr. 1v
4, 22. Haut. tim. 111 3, 28.

299. tiyillum is a diminutive
of Cianum, formed in the same
way as siyillmn from siffnum.
Isidore's derivation from tegulae
(Origxnt 10) is quite groundless.
Most‘of the commentators take
(le suo tigllllo in the, sense of
‘from his house, ’ or, as Hildyard
says, ‘ through the rafters of his
house! As there is no other
passage in any author, where
&stillum would have the sense
of domicilimn breve, I prefer
the explanation given by Pareus
according to which we need not
invent a new sense for this
passage. Euclio thinks that he
is undone, when the smallest
piece of wood is bin-ned in his
house, and he therefore keeps
no wood in the house: see
v. 355.
