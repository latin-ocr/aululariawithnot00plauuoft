(3 PREFACE.

care and have endeavoured to keep pace with the pro-
gress of Plautine studies, though I have found it im-
possible to quote all the treatises and works I have
consulted. Let me hope that the re-issue of my Aulularia
(which has been out of print for some time) will meet
with the same favour as was so largely aocorded to the
first edition. If the second edition proves to be superior
to the first, this should be mainly attributed to the
greater faoility Ι enjoy at my present place of residence
for procuring inore philologioal works, indispensable to
the author of a work like this, than were within my
reaeh at Cottonopolis. By more than one of my country-
men I have been aoeused of ignoring some treatise or
some passage of a grammarian bearing upon the matter
Ι treated of, when in reality the fault lay with the im-
possibility of procui-ing certain works at that time. In
conclusion Ι may be allowed to observe that I have en-
deavoured to preserve calmness of tone and impartiality
of judgment in discussing the various theol-ies of Plau-
tine prosody and the multifarious problems of Plautino
critic-ism.
