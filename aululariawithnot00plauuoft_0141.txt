et illae malam rem metuant quam metuont magis,

480 et n6s minore sumptu simus quam sumus. 10

in maxumam illuc populi partemst optumum :

in pauciores avidos altereaitiost,

quorum animis avidis atque insatietatibus

neque lex neque tutor capere est qui possit modum.

485 namque hoo qui dieat: quo illae nubent divites , 15

dotatae, si istuc ius pauperibus ponitur?

quo lubeat nubant, dum dos ne fiat eomes.
hoo si ita fiat, mores meliores sibi

parent pro dote quos serant quam nunc ferunt.

may briefly draw the attention
os the student to a peculiar-
ity of Latin: in comparisons
the same verb is repeated,
while in modern languages, eg.
English and French, the most
general verb in the language
⁶ to do ' ‘ faire‘ is substituted.

479. mala res frequently de-
notes ‘punishment ’ in the lan-
guage oi the comio writers.

481 ss. This line seems the
sole instance of the construc-
tion bonum est in aliquem ⁶ it is
good for) in would however
admit of the same explanation
as in such phrases as pessume
in te atque in illam consulis
Ter. Haut. tim. 111 1, 28. The
next line contains another dit-
ficulty first pointed out by
Linge de hiatu p. 8: ‘alterea-
tionem facimus cum aliquo,
non in aliquem;’ but in seems
here to denote the object a·
gainst which the altercatio (i.e.
political contention) is directed ε
see Zumpt ξ 314, This very
meaning of altercatio is, how-
ever, only assumed for this
passage.

483. insatietas ‘a greedy dis-
position,' ἅπ. λεγ. Ammianus

· Though

Marcellinus has insatiabilitas.

484. Very probably we should
suppose that Plautus found in
the Greek original of his play a
passage treating of the un-
protected position of wealthy

they have a tutor
(guardian), they are neverthe-
less exposed to the aggressions
of those who are on the look
out for rich matches. The ex-
pression is, however, somewhat
peculiar, as the common phrase
appears to be capere modam
leals alicuius (in legal phrase-
ology), but not lex capit mo-
dum alicuius rei. Possibly, we
should have to write facere in-
stead of capere, or we should
take capere modam in the sense
of ponere (imponere), statuere
(constituere) modam· alicui rei.
We may also say that capere
modum Ξ moderari.

488. For the hiatus si ita
see Introd. p. 68.

489. pro ‘instead of:' see
Key, L. Gr. §1361 c. The phrase
mores serre is to be explained
on the analogy of the usual ex-
pression dotem ferre.
