P. xiv

8 INTRODUCTION.

Or. 20, 67 ‘apud quos [ie. comicos poetas} nisi qaod
versiculi sunt, nihil esc aliud quotidiani dissimile ser-
monis¹.' These two passages should teach us how to deal
with Plautine verses and language. Nevertheless, the
truth was not found out for nearly two centul-ies after
the publication of the first edition of Plautus, and the
earlier editors did not hesitate to recognise Greek forms
and imitations of Greek constructions in the style of
Plautus 3 and as to metre and prosody, they either had
no idea at all of their laws and did not greatly trouble
themselves about them, or, at best, their notions were
very vague and rather like presentiment than the full
possession of truth itself. Francois Guyet, a French
scholar of the 17th century, was the first to study the
versification of the comio poetS, and though his results
were intermixed with a great many eri-ors (as, indeed, it
could not be otherwise), his works seem to have given
the first impulse to Bentley, if we may argue from the
fact that many of Bentley’s emendations in Terence are
already to be met with in Guyet's Commentarii, and that
even some of his caprices occur there? It is difficult to

Terentii comoediis metra vel ea
quasi arcana quaedam et ab
omnibus semota sibi solis esse
cognita confirmant (p.418 Hertz).
Priscian's own conceptions of
the Terentian metres and pro-
sody are, however, far from
correct, thus bearing out Ci-
eero's words that even the an-
cients themselves found it diffi-
cult to understand the metrical
laws of archaic versification.

‘2 It would seem that Bentley
had read Guyet’s work and

noted down most of his emend-
ations; years afterwards, when
he published his own Terence,
he appears to have forgotten
the real author of a great many
of the conjectures he found
scattered over the margin of
his copy, and as he approved of
them, he imagined them to be
his own. It would be interest—
ing to possess Guyet's treatise
(le prosodia versuum Terentii et
Plauti, which his sudden death
did not allow him to finish.
Guyet died in April 1655. His
Commentariz· in P. Terentii Co-
moedias VI were published at
Strasburg, a. 1657 3 the text of
his Plautus appeared at Paris
1658,in 4 vols„ with the French
translation of M. de Marolles.
