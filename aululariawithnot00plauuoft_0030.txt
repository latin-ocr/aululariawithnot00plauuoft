be dropped, the ambiguous nature of this u giving rise
to a diphthong⁷ does not seem without foundation ¹.

Another instance of a shortened e in an imperative of
the second conj ugation is ιασὲ Aul. 325. Similarly we find
tene* .·

adimit animam mi aegritudo z Stasimc, tene me :: visne aquam?
Trin. 1091.

sin secus, patiemur animis aequis. tene sorte-m tibi.
Cas. 11 6, 25.

v. 412 of the Aulularia furnishes us with a good example
' of the vari-able quantity of such imperatives, since we
should there pronounce the first tene as a pyrrhich, but
the second as an iamb. A somewhat analogous instance
occurs in Ovicl's line ⁴ vali> ἰ-(ιῖἅ {nquit et Eclzo' (see
L. Missler, dc re m. p. 308> We may further enumerate
(10σέ Aul. 431. vicl? Trin. 763. Cas. 11 6, 26, and iubev
(see RitscliL Proll. CLXV). It may be useful to add that
the same quantity of the imperative -e of the sec. conj.
occasionally reappears in the Augustali period, e. g. Ovid
has firm? (am. 11 13, 21) ancl lem-5 (am. 11 6, 62), Persius
(Ι 108) and Phaedrus (111 6, 3) have vide< We may also
p.xxviii quote Luc. Mulier's words (de re ni. p. 340) ‘ etiam hanc
licentiam intendere christiani, apud quos inveniuntur at—
tenuata finali time dimove praecave arce emorque per-
censes
The iniperatives of the fourth conjugation show the
same shortening propensity. Thus We have ‘veni (Persa
30) αόῑ (Most. 66) redi (Aul. Sl. 441. Truc. 1 2, 106:
210 Geppert).
It is not difficult to collect more instances of al] the
cases mentioned, but I think those given will suffice to
convince even the most incredulous of the existence of

¹ Compare Juvenal 1x 120, Anthology gives the same pro-
where the ms, reading causis sody (11 p. 154):
has been changed to cave* sis by semper perpetuo vale, mi caris-
Lachmann. sime coniux.
