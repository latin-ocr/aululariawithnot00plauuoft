INTRODUCTION. 15

sibi are used both as iambs (which is their original quan-
tity> and pyrrhichs. Bitschl had originally doubted the
possibility of employing them as iainbs in iambic and
trochaic metre‚ but his theories ha ,76 been refuted by A.
Spengel, Plautus p. 55 sqq.

2. Ι will now proceed to enumerate those termina-
tions in conjuqation which sometimes preserve their origi-
nal long quantity contrary to the general usage of the
Augustan period.

In Plautus' prosody all those endings may be long
in which an original vowel is contracted with the root-
vowel of the verb. Thus Plautus has not only

ᾱε &s {s = ais eis iis
which even later times did not deviate from, but we find
in his verses the third persons analogously long ε
dt ἒῦ {t π ait eit iit.

This is admitted on all sides, · sce Key, Lat. Giam. p. 128,
who quotes Bitschl' s P1011.’Trin. CLxxxm. P10f. Key
justly adds: ‘Theie are not wanting similar enam ples 111
Virgil and Horace3 but edit01s and teachers complacently
get over the difficulty by attributing the unusual length
to the so-called principle of caesura, or to poetical licence. ’
We may notice the same er··101 in Parry's Introduction
to Terence p. LV, where the subjunctive αἰιῃεᾶί (Ter. Ad.
prol.25)'1s attributed to the influence of ‘ictuss 'but the
ending at, just as well as bat 111 the impe1·.‚f was originally
long, as will be seen from the second pei sons ds ὸᾶε and
theo plural cimus dcis, and appears therefore in its ieal p xix
quantity ln the passage alluded to. Thus we have fuat
and ,ςείᾶύ 111 Plautus, and soleat in Horace (Serm. 1 5, 90).
It is the same with the imperfects ροηέὂᾱι (Ε1111. Α1111.
314), amittebat (Virg. Aen. v 853)¹‚ and 69·ᾱύ (Hor. Serm.
11 2, 47). It is the same with the ending et of the sub-

l Lucian Miiller thinks that observations on the whole sub-
the passages from Virgil should ject of lengthened endings‚ de
be corrected according to the re metr. p. 326—333. See also
authority of some mss. See his Nettleship, 1. c. p. 468.
