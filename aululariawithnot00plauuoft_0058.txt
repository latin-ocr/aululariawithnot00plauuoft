50 INTRODUCTION.

But a host of other instances still remains un-
explained and will be unaccounted for, unless we really
admit the truth of the general law laid down at
the head of the present section. We cannot of course
promise to give all, or nearly all, the instances which
should hence be explained, but it will be useful to
mention some prominent exainples, were it only as a
brief exemplification of our law, By carefully studying
the Plautine playS, a rhythmical ear will soon become
familiar with these licenses of prosody, and when 01100

wonderful vivacity and elasticity of the comic versifica-
tion of the Romans, a fact which would have been
perfectly impossible, had the Latin language always been
bound by the prosodiacal setters which, since Ennius'
time, restrained its youthful agility and turned it into
a leW, but majestic and pompous array. These words
are not, however, intended to depreciate Ennius' merits :
for it was he who preserved the language from premature
decay and dilapidation.

We may first draw the reader's particular attention
to two little pronouns which, on account of their fre-
quent occurrence, were liable to an uncertain mode of
pronunciation. We mean ipse and iste: and both oc-
casionally being euclides, it was, of course, left to the
free choice of the speaker, which place to assign to them
in his sentence, i.e. either to run over them by con-
necting them with the preceding word, or to give them
more importance by fully pronouncing their first syllable.
In the first case these pronouns would be pyrrhichs ¹, in
the latter trochees, and accordingly they appear in
Plautus and Terence in both shapes: iste has even a
secondary form sce, which was first discovered by
Lachmann, 011 Lucr. p. 197²: in the same way we may
