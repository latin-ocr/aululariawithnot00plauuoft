quod quispiam ignem quaerat, extingui volo,

84. The word inania, instead
of ἰηαηὶταε, probably owes its
origin to nothing more than the
assonance of aranea. The ὀξύ-
μωρον ‘fun of emptiness' can
hardly be imitated in any
modern language, so as to pre-
serve its entire strength of ex-
pression. Plautus ventmes on
a similar phrase Capt. 111 1, 6
where the parasite calls a fast-
(lay (lies ecfertus fame. Catullus
uses a similar expression (8, 48)
plenus sacculus est aranearum,
and the same 13 found in a line
of Afranius (Ribb. Com. p. 184)
anne arcula tua plenast arane-
arum? Hence we may safely
conclude that this simile was
proverbially used in popular
speech.

86. King Philippus and Da-
rius are here mentioned as the
most obvious and best-known
instances of wealthy lunga the
one as a European, the other
as an Asiatic monarch. Comp.
696 eqo sum ille rex Philippus.

For the usual quantity of Phi-
lippus in Plautus see Introd.
p. 46 3., but in both passages
of the Aulularia the common
quantity is well supported by
the best mss—The form trive-
71ξὴοα occurs only here 3 Bacch.

13 likcwise unexampled in any
other passage.
