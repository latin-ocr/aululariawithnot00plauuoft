D. SHORTENING OF OTHER LONG ENDINGS.

We have hitherto always observed that final syllables
in which the vowel was long by nature were not short-
ened by the sole influence of the accent, unless the words
to which they belonged were originally iambs¹. We have
yet to mention that the same shorteniug process affected
even such endings as would seem to oppose the strongest
resistance to every attempt to shorten them: ds 63 es {3
‘1283 nay, sometimes not only the vowels of these endings
are shortened, but even the final consonante dropped.
Some instances will serve to exemplify this observation.

1. Thus the ending (ῖς appears shortened in bonas

' foras² neyasz

have long held that it would be
better to read it as sen, i. e. as
representing that old lost nomi-
native whence the oblique cases
were deduced, in other words
the simplex· noun of which the
sen-ec is a diminutive.' It is
the pervading tendency of ΜΓ
Key’s theories on Latin versifi-
cation to reduce Latin disylla-
bles and trisyllables to mono-
syllables. Such a proceeding is
indeed very much in the style of
that language which has suc-
ceeded in contracting the noble
ἐλεημοσύνη into a convenient mo-
nosyllabic alms, but it may be
doubted whether these violent
contr-actions suit the genius of
the Latin language.

1 Exceptions to this rule
would be adtuli occidi and
iusserit. But the first may be
explained from tuli, and iussero

follows the analogy of the short
o of the present. occidi occurs
in an anapaestic line, i.e. in so-
called ‘free' metre. frustra
(p. 22) is quite isolated.—
With regard to the dropping of
final consonantS, we have to
modify our statement. s and
m were indeed so frequently
dropped that the prosody of the
antepenult cannot be considered
to limit the extension of this
license. But in all other cases
the law given above would ap-
ply to the dropping of final
consonants just as well. See
our remarks on pater and ‘mater

ing in the Dorio dialect, e.g.

the original prosody in θύρας
