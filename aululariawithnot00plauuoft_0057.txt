INTRoDUcTION. 49

Brix has collected the following instanoes of inde.-
Amph. 1 1, 4. Capt. 1 2, 19. Aul. 11 7, 4. Poen. prol.
2. 1v 2, 80. V 3, 39. ‘ande occurs as a pyrrhich in the
following passages which we likewise borrow from Brix 2
Trin. 218. Capt. 1 1, 41. Cist. 11 3, 19. Persa lv
3, 23. Mil. gl. 111 l, 93. Eun. 11 3, 14. For intro see
my note on Aul. 448.

Even the first syllable in inquam is shortened Capt.
111 4, 39 (see p. 38), a passage where Ritschl boldly sub-
stitutes eqo for inquam.

To these examples we may add the short quantity
of the first syllable in {quave Eun. IV 7, 7¹. So also
iquorabitur Men. 468 according to the mss.

As it is our intention to consider all such instances
as admit of a different explanation from that affordod
by the sole influence of the accent, before mentioning
those examples which compe] us to find the ultimate
cause of the change of quantity in the power of the
accent, we may add here some examples of words in
which x does not lengthen a preceding vowel, e. g.

sed ιῖΧόι· scelesta. Rud. 1v 1, 4.

sibi uxorem. Aul. prol. 32.

ad uxorem. Mero. 11 1, 20.

in exercitum. Amph. prol. 101, 125.
ab exercitu. Amph. prol. 140.

ad exercitum. Amph. 1 3, 6.

mage exigere. Trin. 10522.

In these cases we might explain the violation of
quantity by assuming the soft pronunciation of the a:
as 83 but this would not help us to explain such in-
stances as the following :

ego excludor. Eun. 1 1, 79. Ρ· XlVi·

ibi extemplo. Poen. 111 4, 23.

ti instead of tibi, nor is it pos- VirgiL Aen. Χῖ 733. See my
sible to pronounce qu' inde. See Introduction to Terence, p. 20.
