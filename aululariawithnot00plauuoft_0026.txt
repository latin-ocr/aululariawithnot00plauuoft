22 INTRODUCTION.
a short α in Prudentius and Ausonius1, though it pre-
serves its legitimate quantity in Plautus and the classic
poets. In frustra the a is shortened by Prudentius and
Mareial‘z and the sanie quantity has been established for
Plautus by Brix3 in five instames, where Ritschl and
Fleckeisen had, however, removed it by somewhat violent
alterations.— All adverbs in e were originally ablativesfi
and their final e was therefore long 3 it became, how-
ever, short in many cases 3 it remained so ever afterwards
in bene and maZe⁵‚ while it was common in βενε,- but in
Plautus wc find probe with the same short quantity
The adverb cito
had its final o common in all periods of Latin poeti-y ⁷.
The ablativo-ending e of the third declension was
originally long, e. g. in the following line from the se-
pulchral inscription of Scipio Barbatus:

GnaivOd patre prognatus, {Ortis vir sapiensque.

Ritschl and Fleckeisen admit
even prospere in an anapaestic
line, Pseud. 574. It is, how-
ever, highly probable that this
line should be read as a tro-
chaic octonarius:

eveniunt.

The mss give Iuppiter: Ι have
followed Bucheler's emendation
(Rhein. Mus. xv p. 445).-1n
another anapaestic line, Mil.

gl. 1024, Ritschl reads with the
mss.

age, age, sit tibi maxume con-
cinnumst,

M. Haupt proposes to transpose
the words as follows

age maxume uti tibi c6ncin-
numst.

It is difficult to decide how far
a licence would extend in the
so-called ‘free’ metres; yet in
the first instance we are en-
titled to remove it because tro-
chaic metre follows3 in the se-
cond I should not admit Haupt's
conjecture.
