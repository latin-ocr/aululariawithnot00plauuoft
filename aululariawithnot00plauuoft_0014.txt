10 INTRODUCTION.

professor at Bonn¹. In the following sketch, Ritschl's
theories have been duly weighod, though not adopted to
the exclusion of all others, and proper regard has been
paid to the discussions of Oorssen, whose elaborate work
on Latin pronunciation we have always quoted from the
second edition.

But to return to the two passages quoted from Cicero,—
we need not dwell upon the fact that for a full appre-
ciation of Plautine metres and prosody it is indispensable
to obtain a just idea of the earliest pronunciation of Latin.
Ἀ search after this will not fail to throw much light on
the earliest history of the Latin language3 it will, at the
same time, show that many forins now found in the so-
called Romance languages were already anticipated in the
popular speech of the epoch of Plautus and Terence.
This accounts for the otherwise surprising fact that many
of the latest forms of the Latin langii-age are either per—
fectly identical with the earliest forms or must at least
be traced back to the working of the same laws. This
point is of great importance, but it has been greatly over-
valued in the late Prof. Key's paper ‘On the metres of

{llaiituls and Terence' appended to his treatise on the
1 p a et2.

¹ In 1865, Bitschl accepted
a professorship at the Univer-
sity of Leipzig. His views on
Plautine prosody underwent
some further change in 1869,
when he published his Neue
Plautinische Ercurse, in which
he attempts to remove many
cases of hiatus in the verses of
Plautus by means of the as-
sumption that an ablatival D
was stin employed in the Latin
language at the time of the
second Punic war. See, for
this, Corssen's work on Latin
Pronunciation 11 p. 1005 sqq.
and the Preface to my second
edition of the Trinummus. In
1871, Ritschl published a se-

cond edition of the Trinummus,
but without the Prolegomena of
the first, which are now out of
print and have become rather
a scarce book—C. F. W. Mill-
ler’s work on Plautine Prosody
(Berlin 1869, with an appendix
—Nachtriiye—ISYI) is valuable
on account of the materials col-
lected with great industry: but
Bitschl himself (in his new ed.
of the Trinummus) speaks ra-
ther contemptuously of the an-
thor's critical sagacity, though
Miiller adheres mainly to the
views set forth in Ritschl’s own
Prolegomena. See my pref. to
the Trin.‚ p. xv.
