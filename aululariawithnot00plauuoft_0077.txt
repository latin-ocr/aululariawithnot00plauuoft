mmonUcTION. 69

This kind of hiatus occurs most frequently when the p. lxiii.
long vowel (or a vowel together with m) forms the first
syllable of an arsis resolved into two shorts. This may
be exemplified by comparing the following passages in the
Aulularia : arg: 1 2. 7ηὲ ut id 8. quoi eqo 187. quo abis

201. irim 690 272. rem habere 458. εῖ ica 488. (ἷὲιη hodic

A few words in conclusion. Throughout this chapter,
we have endeavoured to keep free from merely hypotheti-
cal theories which have been brought forward for the
explanation of Plautine prosody. ‘DeJfficilc est ec lubri-
ωιτη] says Ritsclih Proll. Trin p. CLXVII, ‘quid vitae
consuetudo veterum probare vel potuerit vel non potuerit,
assequi ratiocinando ec comminiscendo velle? Unless we
greatly mistake, Ritsehl's own investigations—to follow
which in their gradual development is one of the most
instructive and interesting studies—prove the truth of this
observation. Yet the history of his investigations ap-
pears to teach a lesson which will most likely be the
basis for the labours of the coming time, viz. that we
gain and leam more ancl arrive at more stable results
by means of a critical and conservative observation of
single facts than by specious bnt unsound emendations of
seeming irregularities ¹.
