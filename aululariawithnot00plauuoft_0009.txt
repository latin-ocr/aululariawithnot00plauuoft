PREFACE. 5

In the Introduction Ι have chiefly endeavoured to
give a brief, but clear and sufficient sumniary of the
laws of Plautine prosody. This seemed the more neces-
sary as the results of the investigatione of Ritschl and
other German scholars on this subject are either totally
unknown or, at best, but partially known in this country,
and are moreover not easily accessible to the English
student, they being scattered through Bitschl's Plautus
and prooemia, and many volumes of German philological
periodicaIS.

In concluding this preface, it gives me great pleasure
publicly to acknowledge the manifold obligations which
I owe to Dr Ernest Adams, who has not only kindly
touched my English style in many a sore part, but to
whose hints and suggestions both the Introduction and
notes are greatly indebted.

Thus I dismiss my book, though I feel that it stands
in need of much indulgence and forbearance—I venture
to say that it would be better if I could have written
it at a place more favourable to philological studies than
Manchester.
