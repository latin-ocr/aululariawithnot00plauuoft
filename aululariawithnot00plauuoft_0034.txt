C. DROPPING OF FINAL CONSONANTS.

A careful reader of the Plautine comedies will soon
find out that, for scanning these verses, 110 must very
often free himself from the observance of the rules con]-

’ monly taught under the head of positio. But at the
same time he cannot fail to observe that an absolute
negation of the laws of position 111 Plautus would render
the 0350 even worse, for then we should be at a loss how
to explain many instauces of naturally short vowels
lengthened by position. Most of the cases in question
will be explained bv the following remarks.

The metres of Plautus and Terence lestq'fy a ἔκηεν-αἰ

however, confined to Latin 3 on the contrary, we trace it
in most of the dialects of ancient Italy. Thus, to give a
few examples, we have vestilmtzc:vestz'yium‚ srelttzc:
