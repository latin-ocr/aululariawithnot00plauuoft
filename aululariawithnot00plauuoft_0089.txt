dependent genitive is rarely
omitted (see, however, Cic. de

the adjective is occasionally
used absolutely, e.g. Cistell. 11

the best mss, of Plautus and
should no doubt be uniformly
introduced into the text. The

concutio, inculco, insulto. These
forms occur even in those later
writers who affect an archaia
style, and evcn Martial has
