[Ι. 2. 27—30

105 discrucior animi, quia ab domo abeundumst mihi.

nimis hercle invitus abeo. sed quid agam scio.
nam nobis nostrae qui est magister curiae,
dividere argenti dixit nummos in viros. 3ο

105. For animi we may com-
pare such expressions as dis-
crucior (mimi Ter. Ad. 1v 4, 1
(= 640 Fl.) Antipho me excruciat
animi Phorm. 1 4, 10 (Ξ187).
emcrucias animi Plaut. Mil. gl.
1068 and 1280. anuas te (17111)ιὶ
Epid. 111 1, 6. ‘in sps: pendebit
animi Ter. Haut. tim. 1v 4, 5
<=727)‚ where the genitive
should not be joined with spe,
see Plaut. Mero. 1 2, 18 (2127
R.) animi pendeo aud my note
on the passage. Cicero uses
the same expression Tusc. disp.
1 40, 96 pendemus animi, excru-
ciemur, anyimur: but there
animi is due to an emendation
by Ursinus, the mss. giving
animis. In another passage,
Tuse. 1v 16, 35 the reading
of the mss. is as follows is qut*
adpropinquans aliquod malum
metuit, aranimatusqzce pendet
animi. We have to range
under the same head such in-
stances as falsus animi est Ter.
Eun. 11 2, 43, where the read-
ing animi is expressly men-
tioned by Donatus, though the
mss. give animo: comp. ‘me
animi fallit Lucr. 1 922. In the
same way we have 11119113 animi
Cat. 63, 4, and dubius animi
Verg. Georg. 111 289. See also
Draeger 1 p. 443 sq.‚ and my
note on Trin. 454 satin tu’s
sanus mentis αιιι animi tuiwhich
passage seems to show that
animi is in these constructions
a real genitive (used of relation),

and not a locative, as has been
asserted by some scholare.
Comp. also Epid. 1 2, 35 desi-

piebam ‘mentis and ibid. 11 2, 55

sermonis fallebar.

106. sed is necessary on ac—
count 01 mzm in the following
line. Euclio says that, although
he does not like to go out, he
has nevertheless his reason for
doing so. This reason is given
by 7111711.

107. Vtrum Iegyitimos habent
oni-nes tribu-s divisores 31103, quos
Plautus ηιαῃίείγοε curiarum in
Aulularia vocat? is the question
raised by Asconius 011 Cic. Verr.
1 8, 23, although there is no
serious foundation for it, the
divisores being 110 legally autho-
rised personS‚ but distributors
of bribery money. See Long’s
note and Cic. pro Plancio 19,
48. We may however remark
that the expression magister
curiae is a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον, and.
was doubtless meant as a trans-
lation Of the τριττυάρχης of the
Greek original (see de Aul. p.
15). The whole passage treats
of Athenian life: distributione
of money among the citizens
were very frequent at Athens,
but almost unknown at Rome
before the time of the emperors.
—Observe the fulsomeness of
expression in nobis nostrae, in-
stead of which O. Seyffert has
ingeniously conjectured Nestor
nostrae.

108. dividere instead osse
divisurum esse, in accordance
with the loose construction so
