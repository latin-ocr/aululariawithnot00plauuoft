The same quantity will be found in the Aulularia (v. 90.
600. 610. 652111 is, however, very prob-able that the
final e of cave was at a very early time entirely dropped,
au being pronounced as a diphthong. This view rests on
Cicero de div. 11 40 : cum M. Crassus exercitum Brundisi
imponeret, quidam 'in portu caricas Gamzo advectas ven-
dens ‘caumas’ clamitabat, (neamus, si placet, ‘monitum
ab eo Crassum, ‘caveret ne iret) (The same anecdote is
related by Pliny, N. H. XV 19.) But even the entire
dropping of the final e presupposes a former shortening
of the vowel, at least if we may trust the laws laid
down by the science of comparative philology. We
find the same process in other forms derived from
cave-, e. g. cccu(i)tum cau(i)tor cau(i>ti0: it is the same
with fau(i)tum ficu(i)to·r .· but in all these words there is
reason¹ to assume that Plautus still used the full forms p.xxvii
cavitum cavitor etc„ as shown by Fleckeisen, ep. crit.
XX12. In Plautus’ time, we find the shortening process
in its full vigour and working; in later times (and we
should not foi-get that there are more than 100 years
between Plautus and Cicero) the (ll-opping of those short-
ened vowels seems to have set in already. The con—
