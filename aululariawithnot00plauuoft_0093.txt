I. 1. 111-28]

AVLVLARIA. 85

aut si respexis‚ donicum ego te iussero,

60 continuo hercle ego te dedam discipulam cruci. 20

scelestiorem me hac anu certe scio

vidisse numquam, nimisque ego hanc metuo male,
ne mi ex insidiis verba imprudenti duit

neu persentiscat, aurum ubi est absconditum:

65 quae in occipitio quoque habet oculos pessuma. 25

nunc ibo ut visam, sitne ita aurum ut condidi:
quod me sollicitat plurimis miserum modis.
ST. noenum mecastor, quid ego ero dicam meo

58. respexis = respeoe(es)is =
respexeris: Key, L. G. ξ 566.

59. ‘I'll send you for a
schooh'ngto the gallows‚’ Tuom<-
ΤοΝ. The cross shall teach you
to shut your eyes for ever. if
you cannot keep them shut for
a few moments.

60. In the ms. B we find
here the marginal note ‘hoc
seeum loquitur) which is per-
fectly adapted to the situation.

61. For the prosody of m·-
misque, see Introd. p. 31.

62. duim (compare v. 236
perduint v. 664) is an archaic
subj. preS. See Neue 11 p.
441 sq. The ending im is the
same as seen 111 edim velim
nolim malim sim. Cicero has
this form in the formulas di te
perduint pro rege Deiot. 7, 21,
and. utinam tibi istam mentem
di immortales duint Catil. 1 9,
22. The expression verba clare
which properly means ‘to give
mere words instead os deeds’
commonly assumes the more
general sense ‘to deceive.’

63. persentiscat: ‘smell the
place out, where the gold. is
hidden.’

64. occipitium is the form
more frequently found than
occiput ; comp. also sincipitium

Men. 506, instead of sinciput,
the latter being the only recog-
nised form in good writers.

67. noenumzne oenum (u-
mam), according to the explana-
tion first given by Jacob Grimm.
The word corresponds therefore
entirely with the Greek οὐδ-
αμ-ὦς, and οὐδ-έν, the latter
being frequently used as a sim-
ple negation in later Greek and
constantly so in modern Greek,
where we have moreover the
shortened form δέν. As to the
Latin word, we may observe
that this passage seems the
only one in which at least one
good ms. has kept it. In En-
nius we read it in three places:
ann. 161 somnia vera aliquot,
verum omnia noenu necessest
(non ‘nune the mss„ ‘noenu
H. Ilberg); ann. 314 ‘noenum
rumores ponebat ante salutem
(non enim the mss, noenum
Lachmann) ; and ann. 411 ‘noe—
num sperando cupide rem pro·
dere summam (non in the ms).
When juclging from these ex-
amples‚ it is not without proba-
bility that in many passages
in Plautus where we now read
‘non enim, we should reintroduce
the original reading noenum,
e. g. in the Aulularia itselt
