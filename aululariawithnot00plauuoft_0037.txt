INTRODUCTION. 31

This licence is known to every reader of Lucretius,

and its extension may be shown by a line from Ennius’
Annales (601 Vahlen)

tum lateralis dolor, certissimus nuntius mortis.

Corssen (Ι 286. 599) gives lengthy lists of names from
inscriptions, many of which are as old as the Punic ware»,
and in which a final ε is entirely omitted, and the same fact
occurs again in inscriptions of the decline of the Roman
empire¹. It would, therefore, be very surprising if no
traces of it were found in the prosody of the comio
writers. As instances of it will be frequently met with
in Plautus, we shall confine ourselves to some examples
from the Aulularia. Thus we should pronounce

minus = minu prol. lS. 19.
‘nimisque = nimique 61.
‘nimis z ozimi 49 3.

prius z prin 206.

latus Ξ Catu 415.

‘mayis = maqi 419.

ullas z ullu 419.

venimus Ξ venimu 426.
moribus = moribu 500.

p. xxxii

We shall now easily understand such endings of iambics
as the following, all of which are taken from Terence's
Hecyra: αῑῖσειῖε sic 334. defcsszis sum 443. incertas sum
450. expertus sum 489. mallus sum 653. ‘cisae sic 878.
Oomp. occidistis me Bacch. 313.

‘r was, in many instances, merely a substitute for an
earlier s, ancl we should therefore be prepared to find that

by comparing two lines of En· ed. Vahlen p. 85 and the [oas-
nius and. Virgss. Aen. ΧΠ 115 sage quoted there from Marius
we read Solis equi lucemque Victorinus.) The reason which
elatis naribus efflant, on which induced Virgil to change the
words Servius has the following order of the words appears at
note ‘Ennianus versus est or- once.

dine commutato:fwndzcntqueela- 1 See Schuchardt, on Vulgar
tis naribu' lucem.' <See Ennius Latin, 11 p. 445
