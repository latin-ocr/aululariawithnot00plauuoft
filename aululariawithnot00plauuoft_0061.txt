INTRODUCTION. 53

The word aut appears shortened Bacch. 491, where
Etlegljvzisen reads in accordance with all the mss. as

satin Πὺέ quem tu habeas fidelem tibi aut quoi credas
n selas .

Ritschl admits a hiatus, omits tu and transposes tibi
fidelfilmxien the shortening of the first syllable in audivi
would have to be assumed, if the reading of a line in the
Truculentus (1 2, 92:126 G.) were safely established.
In this passage the mss. give

peperisse eain· audivi z: ah, obsecro, tace Diniarche
z: qiu iam.

But, according to Geppert’s and Studemund's testi·
mony, the Ambrosian palimpsest omits eccm, so that the line
would be unobjectionable. It is, however, not impossi—
ble that the omission of eam is due to the metrica] cor—
rection of some ancient grammarian whose authority was
followed by the scribe of the ms.

Another instance is Epid. v 1, 15 according to the
Ambrosian palimpsest—

1110 dmsixa’c haect fflast autem quam ego emi de praeda
z: a emes .

Comp. also the quantity of Surdczisas Men. 37.

2. We shall now mention some instances where the
usual rules of position have to yield to the rhythmical
influence of the accent. Thus we find the following p. xlix.
combinations of letters without any influenee 011 the
prosodiacal value of the preceding vowels :

α. pb.

mercimonium. acqua dicis, sled ὄρὲᾎῑῗ eccum ipse advenit.
ersa .

nunc adeo ibo illuc, sed optffine gssztgim meum.
erc. .

This is the reading of the mss, in both passages
which Ritschl alters somewhat arbitrarily3 it is, however,
