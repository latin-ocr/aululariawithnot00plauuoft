Α. ARCHAIO Loxe. vowan.

In its most remote period, the Latin languagc abounded p. xvi
111 long and heavy vowels, while at a later period many
of the endings which were originally long became weakened
and were shortened. Some of these endings or suffixes
are occasionally found long even in later writers, but a
great many of these long quantities are still met with
in Plautus and his contemporaries. They are, however,
of rare occurrence in Terence, nay, some of them seem to
have been shortened in the period dividing Plautus from
Terence. In the following pages instances are given of
those suffixes which are used by Plautus 111 their original
long quantity: but the reader should bear 111 mind that
Plautus is by no means consistent 111 attaching to these
suffixes always the same (and no other) quantity 3 on the
contrary, he allows himself considerable licence in treating
them just as it suits his verse. This is, of course, very con-

nouncing Latin verse may be
called a contractive one, since
he makes use of a contracted
pronunciation of certain words
even where metrica] reasons (at
least those generally accepted)
would well admit of the uncon-
tracted forms. E. g. Prof. Key
tells us to read poeta czimprim
cim adem-{bend dppulit’ (‘Alpha-
bet’ p. 146), there being no me-
111661 reason at all, why we
should not admit a dactyl -ψυ
(Ἰ rim dni) instead of the spon-

66 prim dm. I am afraid that
a general application of this
system would reduce Plautine
lines to a monotony quite de-
trimenta] to the charm of con-
versational vivacity we find in
the comic writers. In his work
on ‘Language: its Origin and
Development‚' Prof. Key has
stated his views at greater
length, and we have occasion-

ally referred to some of his
arguments, though we have
found it impossible to enter into
a full discussion of his views,
which do not seem to be shared
by any other scholar.—-It is
scarcely necessary to add that
Prof. Key's theories of ‘scan-
sion' are quite at varianae with
the precepts of the ancient
grammarians, whose authority
is unduly set aside by him. We
may here quote the locus classi-
cus in Marius Victorinus 11 p.
80 sq. ed. Keil: similiter apud
comicos laxius spatium versibus
clatum est...ita dum cotidianum
sermonem imitari nituntur, me-
tra vitiant studio, non imperitia,
quod frequentius apud nostros
quam Graecos invenie& See
