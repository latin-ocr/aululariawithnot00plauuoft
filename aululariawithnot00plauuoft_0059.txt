fairly presume the existence of an analogous form pse,
though there are no historical documents for it¹.

The second class of our instances of violated quantity p. xlvii.

will be divided into two sections : l, violation of quantity
in vowels naturally long 3 2, violation of quantity in
vowels long by position.

1. Under this head we have to mention some very
strong cases 3 but it may be premised that, in almost
every separate instance, some critic has attempted to
remove such offensive violations of regular quantity either
by transposition or some kind of alteration of the text,
i.e. by admitting a kind of criticism which may have its
justification if the ease in question should be quite iso-
lated, but which must be entirely discarded if the multi-
tude of analogous instances defles correction. We simply
put some instances together and let them plead for them-
selves.

The e in an imperfect of the second conjugation is
shortened in the following line ς

quid ad me ibatis? ridiculum verebamini.
Ter. Phor-m. 902 ².

Bentley might well call this an imliqna et tmpz‘s Ζί-
centia, because he was not awai-e of the general law
which accounts for the shortened e.

In Plautus the word Acheruns generally occurs with
a long α, and therefore, as Ritschl observes, ozon produci
brevis syllaba dicenda est in Acheruns per Plautinas
fabulas novem, sed {onya corripi in Poenulo (Proll, Trin.
CLXXI). The passages alluded to by Ritschl are ε

ipse abiit ad Acheruntem sine viatico. Poen. prol. 71.
