30 INTRODUCTION.

Mus. XIV 379)¹.

We shall not therefore be surprised to

find numerous instances in which a final m is entirely
discarded in Plautine prosody, e. g. domum is to be pro-

nounced as domu Aul. 148 ete.

We shall not here give

any special instances of this fact, but it will be useful to

p. xxxi draw the particular attention of our readers to the two

words quidem and enim, which should frequently be pro-
nounced asffuz'de and eniss (Aul. 209. 496 etc).

Even in later poetry, a final m was entirely disre-
garded in all cases where the next word began with a
vowel, this being the last traca of a licence which had
” formerly extended over a lai-ger territory.

As to s, we have a very memorable passage in Cicero's
Orator 48, 161 ‘qum etiam quod iam sulm-[fficiam videtur,
olim autem politius, eorum verboram quorum eaedem,
erant postrenum duae litterae quae sunt in ‘optumus’
postremam litteram detrahebant, nisi vocalis insequebatur.
im ozon erat ea offensio ‘in versibus quam nunc fufium
poetae novi. ita enim, loquebamur ‘qm' esc omnibu' prin-
ceps‚' non ⁴ omnibus princeps-⁷ et ‘ vita illa cligsnu’ locoqaess

uon ‘ difflues-²?

1 A pentameter ends with the
words zindectmposcAnthol. 1203,
12: the final m should of course
be dropt. As Bitschl observes,
we need. not assume the con-
struction of post with an abla-
tive in such a line as cunctarum
haec soboli sedem post morte re-
liquit (Anthol. 1v 394 Burm.).

and Bergk (zeitschrift fii]- die
alterthumsurissenschast 1848 p.
1130) assume a monosyllabie

pronunciation of quidem and
enim. It would be preposterous
to deny the possibility of such
a fact,—and indeed some argu-
ments, especially one alleged
for enim byBergk, seem strongly
to point to it. But as it can-
not be concludes] on the evi-
dence of the Plautine meti-es,
we think it safer to follow a
general theory which affords
an equally satisfactory explana-
tion, instead οἱ assuming an
exceptionalpronunciationwhich
would after all not be support-
ed by entirely undoubted argu-
ments. See also Key's ‘Lan-
