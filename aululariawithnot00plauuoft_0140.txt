471 ss. Megadorus, who as
a worthy old man is naturally
inclined and entitled to criti-
cise social nuisances and com-
plaints, supports in the follow-
ing scene the reforming views
entertained by Cato and his
political friends. There are
besides the present passage so
many allusions in the comedies
of Plautus to the great lusu-
ry of the Roman laches, that
it would be preposterous to rely
on them for the ehronology of
the plays themselves: but only
two soenes are found in the
nineteen plays extant, where a
considerable number of lines
is exclusively devoted to this
subject, and surely such long
passages cannot be treated like
occasional allusions‚ as their

tendency and purpose are open-
ly avowed (comp. here v.
474 ss.). The one of these
passages, Epid. 11 2, 38-51,
cannot originally have formed
part of the scene in which it
stands now, as I have shown
elsewhere, and should therefore
be left out of the question; but
the other, i.e. the present scene
in the Aulularia, we are entitled
to use for placing the Aulu-
laria after the year 560, nay we
may even go further and range
it among the later plays of the
poet.
