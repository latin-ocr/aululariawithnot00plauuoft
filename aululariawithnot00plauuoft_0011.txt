INTRODUCTION.

ΟΝ LATIN PRONUNCIATION AS SEEN IN
THE VERSES OF THE OOMIO WRITERS.

ANYONE who undertakes the reading of Plautus and
Terence on the sole strength of his acquaintance with the
rules of prosody and versification observed by Virgil and
Horace, will be sorely puzzled to scan the verses of the
two comio poets: he will indeed find it no less difficult
than Horace himself whose metrical principles are im-
plied in the line Zeyitimumque sonum diyz'cis callemus et
aure (A. P. 274). But the ears of those Romans for
whom Plautus wrote his plays, were by no means the
same as those of the contemporaries of Horace, and it
would be more than an anachronism, it would be the
greatest injustice to the old poets, if we were to measure
their versification by the standard of the refined laws of
the Augustan period, or to blame thern for not having
adapted their ‘prosody to rules unknown to them. The
principle which should guide us in our judgment of the
verses of the comio poets, is pointed out by Cicero, Orator
