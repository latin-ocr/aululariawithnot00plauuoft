INTRODUCTION. 59

(This is the reading of the mss. 3 Guyet, Bentley
and Fleckeisen modo 85¹.)

But we shall stop here, though it would be' easy to ac-
cumulate more examples of similar ‘violations of p1·osody.’
We use this expression, although it is quite erroneous
when applied to Plautus or other comic writers. For
them that prosody which prevails in Horace and Virgil
did not exist, and they could not therefore ‘violate' it.
Their sole guide in 1⁷›rosodiacal matters was their ear, and
in many cases, they obeyed the dictates of the rhythm-
ical, rather than of the quantitative, laws of the language.
This proves the influence which the accent exercised
on the quantity of many syllables 3 but this should not
be confounded with another question: did tlte ancient
Roman poets purposely attempt to make the metrical stress
of their verses ayo-ee with the prosaic accentuatz'on of every-
da life?

yThe theory that the natural accent of the Latin was, p. liv.
in the earliest period of Latin poetry, an important factor
in versificaffion, which decided its whole character, was
first established by Bentley in his ‘ Schediasma.’ Never-
theless, Bentley could not carry out his theory without
allowing a difference between natural and metrical accent
in the first and last dipodies, because without this liberty
it would have been a mere impossibility to adapt Greek
metres and versification to the Latin language. Bentley
was, of course, obliged to correct a great many passages
in Terence which were at variance with his theory, and
correct them he did undauntedly. His theory was adopted
by G. Hermann (el. d. m. p. 141), though with the ad-
mission, that the poets to whom it applied did not seem
to follow it consistently23 and the same theory is the
groundwork of Ritschl's views as developed in the xvth ans]
xvlth Chapters of the Prolegomena. In the versification of
the comio writers, Ritschl discovers a struggle between a
