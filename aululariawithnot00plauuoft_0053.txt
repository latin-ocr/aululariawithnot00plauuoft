INTRODUCTION. 45
frequently doubled¹, there being almost no difference
between the pronunciation of a single or a double ΖΞ,
Plautus, who wrote ile, had therefore unlimited license
to lengthen the i (i. e. to assume a slower and weightier
pronunciation of the l as ll) wherever sense or metre
seemed to require it, or to shorten it, whenever the word
did not appear to be of much importance. In fact, the
short pronunciation of the i in ille occurs in Plautus in
more passages³ than that quantity which this word
retained ever since the prosody of the Latin language
was entirely reformed and fixed by Ennius’ dactylic
oetr .

p Tiie superlative simillumae has a startling quantity
in a line in the Asinaria (241),

portitorum simillumae sunt ianuae len6niae.

But when seen under this point of view, we understand
this seeming irregularity at once. Plautus himself who
wrote similumae was at entire liberty either to say
simillumae, or in drawing the accent back 011 the ,first
syllable to shorten the second, which was the less ob-
jectionable‚ because ll (according to the latter spelling)
had indeed a very weak sound4.

1 See the instances collected Biicheler, Rhein. Mus. xv 435,

by Corssen, 1 227. For Polio
Pollio, Popilius Popillius, see
Ritschl’s note on the life of
Terence by Suetonius, in Reif-
ferscheid's edition oi the frag-
ments of Suetonius, p. 512.

² In the name Achilles the i
appears short in the first line
of the prologue to the Poe-
nulus:

Achssem Aristarchi mihi eom-
mentari lubet.

The spelling Achilem stands
‘thus' 111 BC and the short q-uan
tity of the i may be defended
by a line from Plautus' Mer-
cator (488)'Ac]1fzzem orabo, ut
aarum mihi det, He’ctor (11ιί esc-
pemzis suit. For this line see

and 011 the whole question M.
Crain, Plaut. Stud. p. 13. We
may add the line Mil. gl. 1219,
in which the mss. warrant the
following reading
mitto iam ut occidi 'Achssles
civis passus est.

Bothe justly wrote Achiles
Plautus himself spelt this name
Aeiles, a spelling actually found
in an ancient inscription on a
cista discovered at Praeneste:
C. Ι. L. 1 1500 (p. 553). We
may compare the two forms
Ἀχιλλεύς and Ἀχιλεύς as found
in Homer.

3 Abundant examples will be
found in Corssen, 11 624 sq.
