42 INTRODUCTION.

to acknowledge any difference between literary and popu-
lar dialects, these pages are not destined¹.

The shortened quantities of these syllables were
once doubted by Ritschl, who in his edition of Plautus
gets rid of them partly by very extravagant alterations
of the ms, readings, partly by assuming the exn-usion
of the radica] vowels of the words in question. I pro-
pose to give a brief criticism of the latter point, in
translating a passage from M. Crain's excellent paper
‘ Plautinische Studien,’ p. 12 :

“ G. Hermann (el. d. m. p. 65) considers domi boni

⁴ mali malum as monosyllables in many passageS‚ though

he has never produced his arguments for the possibility
of putting together such thoroughly different cases. In
accordance with G. Hermann's views Bitschl assumes
monosyllabic pronunciation for enim aput quidem fores
manus senex simul, on which he remarks ‘quae quis tam
pravo iudicio est ut correptis potius ultimis syllabis* quam
pronuntiando elisis· primis dicta esse contendat ,2’ (Proll.
Trin. CXL. s.) But where are the proofs for the pos-
sibility of extruding a radical vowel [in Iambic words]‚
to preserve which in its integrity must always be con-
sidered to be the tendency of language'l It is true,
Ritschl says ‘quid? quod oze usu recepta quidem ‘mono-
syllaba scriptura alius vocis cuiusdam cle vera ratione
admonuit? nam quid est quo a monosyllaba bonas vel
senem forma mnas differat pro minas scribi solitum? ’
(p. CXLIV). I intentionally give this passage without
the least omission, as it would otherwise be incredible
that Ritschl could have written such things. It, is
easy to understand that Ritschl actually compares
matters of a very different character. We want the
proofs for the extrusion of a radical vowel in Latin
