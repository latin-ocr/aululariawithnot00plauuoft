583, Brix (jahrb. 1865 p. 56)
pointed out that the lines which
I have now included in brack-
ets, were but a parallel passage
originally added in the margin
of the archetype of our mss,
and did not therefore belong to
the Aulularia. For⁷ as he ju-
(116101151)7 says, we can only
understand them of an amor
meretricum, 111 which ease it
would indeed be the duty of a
faithful servant to restrain his
master: but 111 the present case
Lyconides is bent 011 lawful mar-
riage without being very deeply
in love, and as he does not
doubt of Euclio's consent (which
appears from 1v 10), it would be
a superfluous presumption of
his slave to attempt to keep
him back (retinere ad salutem».
Such parallel passages have
sometimes been added in the
11155. of the Plautiue comcdies,
e.g. Μ611. 984 a passage from
the 6011111161166111611101111111οω111
act of the Mostellaria.

an attentive slave should under-
stand how to read his master's
looks. The expression was no
doubt proverbial like the Ger-
