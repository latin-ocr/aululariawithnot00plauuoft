11111110 equidem credo :: at scin etiam qu6modo?
ain audivisti? :: iisque a principio omnia.

In both instances it would not be very difficult to
avoid the hiatus by writing set instead of at in the first,
and inserting aio before usque in the second line. But
as a hiatus of this kind is by no means very rare, we
shall adhere to the authority of our mss.

To proceed, Ritschl allows no such hiatus as we have p. lxi.

Trin. 185,

0111 mea malefacta, 0111 meam avaritiam tibi,
according to the reading of all our mss. He writes
therefore

en 111011 malefacta, meam en avaritiam tibi,
to which Fleckeisen justly prefers Hermann’s reading

en 111οά 11ὸί malefacta, 011 meam avaritiaim tibi1.

Or, to give another instance, Trin. 7 76, 1110 reading of
all our mss. is as follows ε
(101 alteram ssli. Alteram dicat tibi,

which Ritschl changes 11110
1111 det alteram, alteram dicat tibi.

In both cases Brix has kept the reading of the mss,
and we think him the more entitled to do so, as it re-
quires a great deal of arbitrary criticism to correct all
other instances of the same kind. It is therefore possi-
ble to maintain the reading of the mss. in the following
lines in the Aulularia :

695. memorare nolo, 116111111111112 mendicabula.
561. potare ego hodie, Ε1101103, tecum 11010.
704. atat, eccum ipsum. 1bo, ut hoc condam, domum.
