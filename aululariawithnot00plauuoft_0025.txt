should be required that in modo the final o was actually
shortened, the word noc being contracted to a mono-
syllable, it suffices to quote Horace, Serm. Ι 9, 43 ;

mim victore sequ6r. Maecenas quo modo tecum?

In this case, the monosyllabic pronunciation qubmo would

violate the 111611-6.

And if we find the o shortened by so

nice a judge of Latin prosody as Horace, we shall cer-
tainly not 116311616 10 acknowledge the same fact 111 the
conversation-al language of Plautus1.

A whole class of words belongs to the same category
as the ablatives just mentioned: viz. prepositions and
adver-bs, 111 which the final α 61111 o were originally ab·

he is frequently indebted to
Prof. Brix for the instances
quoted, though the order and
arrangement in Brix's book
differ totally from the present
sketch. The chapters 01 Ritschl's
Prolegomena which deal with
the same matters, are still very
useful for furnishing examples
of all kinds, but as to 1116 (100-
trine 113611 propounded in them,
there is not one page where
Ritschl himself could now dis-
pense with many alterations
We should not, however, forget
that it is due to Ritschl 111111-
3611 that we now possess sound—
er theories than in 1116 year

1 In his work on ‘Languagez
its Origin and Development’
(published 1874), Prof. Key has
repeated his theory 01 the pro-
nunciation 01 quomodo as quo-
mo, ‘notwithstanding the dis-
sent 01 Dr Wagner’ (p. 131),
but without replying anything

Thus we have contra, which is read with

to the argument I had deduced
from Horace. I may, therefore,
be excused 101· maintaining my
own theory, as my arguments
would seem to be no less valid
now 111611 they appeared to me
1611 years ago. I may add that
Schuchardt has dealt with the
Rornance forms 111 his work on
Vulgar Latin, 11 393 ; but while
Prof. Key treats mo as ‘an in-
stance 01 a silent d‚' Schuchardt
proves from 1116 Corsican cumed
and the Lombard comocl (which
is also contracted into 0111011),
11161 11ιο owes its origin not 111
contraction (modo moo mo) but
to apocope (mod mo). The dis-
appearance of the final syllable
(o) is in agreement with the
general law, according to which
along vowel first becomes short,
being attacked as it were by a
kind 01 consumption, which
terminates in death, when it
falls off altogether. The final
stage is that 01 1116 Romance
languages, the middle stage 13

Augustan poets.
