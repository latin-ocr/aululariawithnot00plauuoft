merely quantitative metrical accentuation and the real
accent of everyday life. According to his theory, the
natural accent of the language still exercised great influ-
ence upon the versification of Plautus and his contem-
poraries, while it was entirely disregarded in the Au-
gustan period, when a merely quantitative system of
versification became dominant.

An accurate examination of this theory is due to the
joint labours of Franz Ritter, A. Bo'ckh, Weil and Ben-
loeW‚ and Corssen.

In the first place it may be observed that the Latin
language is, ou the whole, of a trochaic and iambic character
with regard to its usual accentuation, and that accent and
quantity coincide in Latin to a far greater extent than
in Greek. We may, therefore, be prepared to find a
general coincidence between the prosaic accent and the
metrical ictus in the metres of the dramatists, without
being at once obliged to assume that this agreement
was something studiously contrived and souglit after by
the poets themselves.

This observation is fully borne out by the facts of the
case. If the earlier poets had purposely endeavoured to
reconcile the metrical ictus of their verses with the prose-
accentuation of the words employed in them, it would
seem a fair infel-enee to expect that in them the propor—
tion of agreement would be greater than in the later
poets, for whom such an attempt has not been assumed.
But precisely the reverse proves to be the case, and there
is indeed, as has been statistically proved by Corssen¹‚ a
far greater proportion of this coincidence in the later
than in the earlier poets. This fact harmonizes with the
general development of Latin poetry, which ended by
becoming entirely accentual (i.e. the accent determined
the quantity, as is the case in most ¹modern languages),
while it had originally been quantitative.
