122 AVLVLARIA. [ΙΙ. 8. ‘233 9. 7.
Apollo, quaeso subveni mi, atque adiuva,

quia in re tali iam subvenisti antidhac: 26

Dr0m6, desquama piscis: tu, MachaeriQ

the exclamation. Various at-
tenipts have been made to fill
up the hiatus by the, addition
of some syllable or other, but
none appears to be satisfactory.

392. Euclio implores Apollo
in his quality as ἀλεξίκακος.
The line may possibly be au
allusion to some event in which
Apollo protected by his personal
interference the treasures of
some temple against tl-iieves or
bordes of barbarous invaders.
This may possibly have been
the aggression of the Gauls un-
der Brennus who threatened
Delphi: see Justin's account
xxw 6 sqq. It should, however,
be confessed that this allusion
(no doubt intelligible to a Greek
audience at the time of the first
performance of the Greek origi-
nal of the Aulularia) reads some-
what obseurely in the Latin ad-
amatica—anthime is archaic
instead of antehac. The full
form of the preposition ante was
antid or amed (comp. postici

prod red).

393. For εάρῖιὶε see Introd.

p. 47. This pronunciation had
already been suggested by Hare
in his ms notes where he
compares Trin. 725.—What is
meant by fures themata-arci, is
clear enough; but thesaurarius
appears to be a ἅπαξ >xe-y.

396. With this line a passage
from Ter. Ad. 111 3, 23 ss. is
generally compared. The word
exdorsuare occurs only here and
iu Appuleius.

39⁴3. ludius is in Labbaeus'
Glossaries p. 109 rightly ex-
plained ὑποκριτής. Thornton re-
marks ‘The ludii were young
lads employed in the public
spectacles ; our author adds
volsus (plucked)‚ because they
used at the time of puberty to
have the down or hairs plucked
from their ehins to keep their
faces smooth! The word is no
doubt connected with ludere
‘to play,’ and the common
spelling lydius due to the erro-
neous derivation from the Ly-
dii, i. e. Etruscans: see Dionys.
Halic. 11 97. Comp. ῑιιάἱο.
