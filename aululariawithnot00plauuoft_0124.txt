322. The explanation of the
expression cocus munditialis is
not quite settled, and we learn
from Festus (p. 173 Μ.) that
the ancient grammarians them-
selves were not quite agreed
with rcgard to the explanation
of this passage. fluminalis
would come from nundinae
(zum-endinae) and would of
course mean a very bad and
worthless eook hired only 011
fair-days. I should however
prefer the other reading, which
is clearly indicated by Festrm,
but generally confounded with
munditialis, and this is 'nundin-
lis. novendialia are explained
in an old glossary ἔνατα ἐπὶ νε-
κροῦ ἀγόμενα (see e. g. Petron.
65): cocus mundialis would thus
signify a cook hired for the so-
called ‘silicernium,’ and for ies-
tivals of that nature not the
best cooks seem to have been
generally hired. The leno Bal-
lio says of a very bad cook in
this sense quin ob eam rem Orcus

third 71, 111 the word nundinali-3
is by the hand of a correct013
see Lorenz's progr. p. 9.

323. 1 have not adopted the
spelling Iittrarum, though there
is little doubt that we should
actually pronounce so. It is
not very probahle that trium
is capable of a monosyllabic
pronunciation.

324. Congrio is not slow to
understand Anthrax’s meaning,
and retort upon him. (Comp.
Cas. 11 2, 49 where fures are
called litterati.) Anthrax gives
him the title of thies (Fvn), and
he calls him fur trifurcifer. On
furcifer Ι add the explanation
given by Donatus on Andr. 111
5, 12 ‘furciferi dicebantur qui
ob leve delictum cogebantur a
dominis ignominiae magis quam
supplicii causa circa vicinos
furcam in collo ferre, subligatis
ad eam manibus, et praedicare
peccatum suum simulque con-
monere eeteros ne quid simile
admittant.’ tri· adds to the
strength of the expression, comp.
trivenefica v. 86. The same
word trifurcifer occurs twice
Rud. 111 2, 29 S. It is by no
means the same with trisur v.
625. ⁴
