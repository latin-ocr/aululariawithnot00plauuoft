qui anui erat peculiaris pe'rdidit paenissume.
fibi erat haec defossa, occepit ibi scalpurrire ungulis
circumcirca. quid opust verbis? ita mi pectus per-

acuit :

capio fustem, optrunco gallum, furem manufesta-

rium.

credo edepol ego illi mercedem gallo pollicitds coquos,

homo trioboli-aiebat portendi
mihi i.e. what else could I have
expected? Cas. 1 1, 43 nocta
ut condigne te cubes (i.e. very
badly) curabitur. See also
Bacch. 392. Men. 906 ; only
Capt. 1 2, 22 the adverb has not
an ironical sense.—9allin‹ice?us
is the quantity of this word in
Plautus, Lucilius, Titinius (126
Ribb.) and Phaedrus : see Lach-
mann on Lucr. p. 36. —Biicheler
(rhein. Mus. xx 441) quotes the
spelling yallinacius· (instead of
the common quilinaceus) from
the best authorities in Varro

Ὀνος λ. 11, Cicero Mur. ξ 61,

Phaedrus 111 12, 1, Petron. 86
and an inscription Orelli 4330.
In the same way we have the
otherwise unexampled forma-
tion viracius in a fragment of
Varro's Meleager (see Riese,
rhein. Mus. xxr 121).

463. The adverb paenissume
recurs v. 660. That the first
syllable should be spelt with
a diphthong, appears from
Priscian who in two passages
declares paenissime to be the
superlative oi paene: see
Bitschl's note on Most. 656.
This derivationis also borne out
by the meaning ‘very nearly.⁷

464. scalpurrire appears to
be a ἅπ. λεγ.; it is by no means
a desiderative, in which case

the u would be short and we
ought to have sculptili-ire (as
indeed most editors perversely
read: conf. also scalptztrio κα-
τακνάω Gloss. Labb. p. 165),
but it is of the same forma-
tion as liffurrire and scaturrire
(Zumpt ξ 232): for liqztrrire
(not ligurire) see Bentley's note
on Ter. Eun. v 4, 14.

465. peruenit ‘became ex-
asperated‚' comp. Bacch. 1099
hoc hoc est quo pectusperacescit.
The word does not occur else—
where.

466. The adjective manufes-
tarius recurs Trin. 895. Mil. gl.
444. Bacch. 918.- in allusion
to the last passage the word is
used by Gellius 1 7. All other
writers say manifestus. — ‘ mani-
festus fur est qui in faciendo
[ἐπ’ αὐνοφώρῳ] deprehensus est·
Paullus, Sent. 11 31, 2.

468. The u in maniibrium
cannot be lengthened by the fol-
lowingletters br, sincemutacum lx
liquida never has that effect in
Plautus, wizanubrinm properly
means a hilt or a handle, but
here it assumes a figurative
sense ‘occasion‚ opportunity.'
Plautus has the word in only
one other passage, Epid. 516
(Bothe) malleum sapientiorem
vidi excusso mcirmbrio, a line
which is omitted in all our
