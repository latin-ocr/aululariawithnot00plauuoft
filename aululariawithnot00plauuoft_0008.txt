4 PREFACE.

be added. It may be that only a few scholars will care
for the critical notos, but surely many students will
desire to have explanatory notes, without which tho
edition would to them be quite useless. As it is my
opinion that no Latin author can be advantageously
explained in the same language, I have written my
notes in English, though I am well aware that 111 so
doing Ι must rely on the forbearance and kindness of
*my readers, who will, I hope, not be very strict in the
case of a foreigner whose acquaintance with the English
language is not of very long standing. Ι may say that
I have read and studied all the commentaries ever
written on the Aulularia, and there scarcely can bc any-
thing of importance in them which would not be found
111 my notes. But at the sanie time, I have tried to
avoid all unnecessary and superfluous erudition which
seemed to have no connexion with the explanation of
the text. On the whole I venture to hope that a stu-
dent will after the pei-usal of my notes be sufficiently
prepared for a critical study of the Plautine comedies.
1 have not thought my commentary to be a place
wherein to mention the names of former commentators
whenever I am indebted. to them for explanations 01·
quotations ,- there is indeed a great deal of exegetical
matter running through all comment-aries, and well-
known to every scholar ; special mention has, however,
been thought necessary in exceptional cases where pe-
culiar honour seemed due to the discovery of difficult
explanations or happy quotations. VVhether the original
additions and illustrations given in the present com-
mentary will be thought an improvement or not, I must
leave to my readers to decide. ’
