INTRODUOTION. 43

[Iambic] words, and Ritschl alleges the Greek μνᾶ,
which the Romans (to whom the joint consonants mn
in the beginning of a syllable are unfamiliar) trans-
formed into mina by inserting a short i: but of course
the Greek form could equally well remain in use. That
a Roman could not say snex instead of senex, mnus for
manus, qu’dem for quidem, seems, in the absence of any
satisfactory evidence to the contrary, pretty clear 3 and
indeed such forms as am’r and en'm (Proll. Trin. CLXVII)
may be good. enough for Etruscan or Polish‚ but they are
not Latin.'’

The same arguments as those alleged in this extract,
are brought forward by Oorssen ΙΙ 623¹. Ritschl has now
himself entirely altered his theories, and I should not
even have mentioned his former views, had it not been
for the presumption that most of the current information
about Plautino prosody in this country is derived from
Ritschl’s Prolegomena, which, it must be repeated, are
in this respect entirely antiquated.

I may add that, in accordance with the short
quantities of vides abis etc. we find viden royda iuben
adin ‘redin etc., forms which stand for videsne royasne
iubesne adi-sne redlsne .· see Comsen, ΙΙ 642.

E. FURTHER INFLUENCE or THE ACCENT. p. xli.

In all the instances which we considered in the
preceding pages, we confined omselves to the quantity
of the final syllable, and it appear ed that all the. changes
in question were limited to a certain number of iambie
words. We may express this rule in the formula—
