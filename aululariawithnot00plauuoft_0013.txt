INTRODUCTION. 9

speak too highly of Bentley’s merits with regard to
Plautus and Terence 3 but like most of his works, even
his Terence was merely an eactempore perform-auce and
bears the traces of haste: though for all this, it will con-
tinue to be one of the soremost works of Classical philo-
logy. It would, however, be totally preposterous to
think that Bentley’s famous ,S'checliasma furnishes the
real key to the full understanding of Plautine prosody
and metres. Gottfried Hermann, whom his excellent
teachcr Reiz¹ had early made familiar with Bentley's
Terence, adopted and refined his views both 111 1113
editions of the Trinummus and the Bacchides, and in
his Elementa doctrinae metricae (1816), where 116 has
often occasion to speak of Plautine passages and to emend p. xv
them. F. Ritschl, whose name will always be connected
with that of Plautus, declares in his dedication of the
Prolegomena to the Trinummus, that, next to the great
Bentley, he considers Gottfried Hermann (whose pupil
he was at Leipzig) as his sole guide in the criticism
of Plautus. This admits, however, of many restrictions.
Ritschl does not adhere to the same principles through—
out his edition of Plautus. Many facts which he did
not acknowledge in his Prolegomena, were admitted in
the prefaces to the different parts os the second and
third volumes, some even were tacitly given up. After
the appearance of the Mercator (the ninth of the plays
edited by Ritschl), his views undet-went so radical a
change that he was obliged to discontinue his -work until
further materials had been collected towards the history
of archaic Latin. What he now holds as to Plautine
prosody, etc. is developed in an excellent paper in the
Rheinisclzes Asuseum vol. xlv p. 400 ss, and most of the
proofs of his views are contained in the numerous prooemia,
which it was his duty to write twice every year while
