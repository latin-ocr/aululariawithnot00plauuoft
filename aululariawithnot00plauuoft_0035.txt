INTRODUCTION. 29

It‘ may be useful to premise that in many cases the
Latin language‚ when first employed for literary pur- p. xxx
poses, had already lost many final consonants : eg. from
the original genitives

mensa-is servo-is re-is
we have after the loss of the final s

mensai servoi rei
mensae servi (re)

The formation of the abl. sing. gives us another instance.
Originally this case ended in cl: mensad serrocl patred
‘manuel ‘recl .· this cl was however dropped there as well as
in the adverbsfacilecl etc„ which were originally ablatives.
These losses are previous to Plautus' time, and in his
language we find but obscure traces of them lefffl. We
read in a few instances a nom. plur. of the sec. decl. in
153², and the forms med and ted are still used by Plautus,
not by Terence. (See note on V. 120.) We may now
proceed to enumerate those instances where final con-
sonants are dropped (i. e. do not count with regard to versi-
·fication) in Plautus and Terence, contrary to the usage of
the later or classical language.

m. We learn from Priscian Ι 38 (Hertz) ‘m obscurum
in eaetremz'tate dictionum sona& and Quintilian states the
same IX 4, 40 ²(m) parum eoeprimitccr...neque enim eximi-
tur, sed obscuratur! On account of its weak sound, a
final m was often neglected in writing both in nouns and
verbs, as will be seen in numerous instances collected
from the oldest inscriptions by Corssen 1 267 sqq. This
disregard of a final ‘m seems to have been quito familiar
to all the popular dialects of Latin throughout its different
periods‚ and hence we should explain hexameters ending
ardentem laica-nam, iuvenilem ιΐὶζμῖναηι (quoted from
{Meyer's Anthology 1223, l. and 1171, 4 by Bitschl‚Rhein.
