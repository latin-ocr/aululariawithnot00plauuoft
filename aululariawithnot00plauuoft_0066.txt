58 INTRODUCTION.

by means of conjectures sometimes very arbitrary, eg.
Mil. gl. 542 s. 3 the mss. (ABG) would give us thc follow-
ing text :

perque tua genua : quid obsecras me? z: inscitiae
meae et stultitiae ign6scas. nunc demam scio.

In this case quid obsecras me would be a very natural
and convenient question, the slave having said two lines
before te obsecro. Ritschl gives, however, as follows:

perque tua genua :z quid iam? 2: meae ut inscstiae
et meae stultitiae ignoscas. nunc demum scio.

Every student of the Plautine plays cannot but agree
with the opinion of Prof. Key, who calls Ritsehl's text
‘in not a few instances untrustwm‘thy,' because it differs
‘ what with omissions, insertions, changes and transposi-
tions of words, and not unfrequently of lines, from what
the mss. sanction, by a very considerable percentage.'
But then again, the mss. are not our sole and exclusive
guides, and it would be even more strange to be ruled by
them in all instances.

(This is the reading of the mss. given by Fleckeisen.
while Bitschl has sine nummo. In the Prolegomena,
p. CXLVIII, he thinks of pronouncing s'n’arqento. In the
passage from the Captivi Fleckeisen writes aut arqenti
against the authority of the mss.)
