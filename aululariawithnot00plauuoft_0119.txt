Smomms returns from the
market with two cooks and. two
music-girlswhomMegadorushas
hired for the celebration of his
nuptials with Euclio's daughter.
In the following dialogue be-
tween Strobilus and. the cooks
we have a lively, though comi-
cally exaggerated, picture of
Euclio's meanness and avarice.

281. Congrio plays upon his
own name and the expression
de'spertire obsonium used by
Strobilus By obsonium and
ὄψον especially fish was under-
stood, whence ὀψάριον 111 the
language of the New Testament
simply means ‘fish' (comp. the
modern Greek ψάρι). Strobilus
having signified his intention to
divide the obsonium into two
parts, Congrio replies that 110
shall certainly not divide him,
just as if he was afraid of being
comprehended under the cate-
gory offish‚ the emmer being a
kind of 001, which was cut into
pieces before it was cooked
(comp. v. 396). For dispertire
he substitutes (lividere, a word
which is sometimes used in a
dishonest sense: 500 Petron. 11
