trecenti : circumstant phylacistae in atriis,

by both sexes: for men it was
called subucula, for women in-
tusium (Feri-ar. de re vest. 3, 1
p. 175), precisely as the English
distinguish between shirt and
shift. The neglige or morning-
dress of ladies indoors consist-
ed, as we see from many pas-
sages in Ovid and Propertius,
in nothing but such a shirt
which when fitting very tightly,
did not even require to be fast-
ened by a belt...but as it might
easily become very troublesome
on account of its length, it was
generally kept together by a
semizona, at least until the pro-
per tunic was thrown over it!

506. cararius occurs only
here: aeraria stands in the
mss. Mil. gl. 694, where the
reading seems however very un-
certain. Comp. Ov. ars am.

507. linteo ‘a linen-weaver’
occurs here, in Servius on Aen.
vn 14, and an inscription Gru-
ter p. 38, 15.——calce0larius ‘a
shoemaker,' ἅπ. λεγ.

508. ‹liabathrarius ‘ a maker
of slippers‚' occurs only here,
diabathrum (i. e. the Greek διά-
βαθρον) is quoted from Naevius
by Varro.

509. solearius occurs only

here and Gruter 648, 13; molo-
cinarizcs (or moloch.) here and
111 an inscription Muratori 939,
6. Ι am inclined to consider
this line as spurious: for, first

· of all, why should the solearii

be nzimed after the diabath-
rarii. ² and then, how could 1110
poet name solearii and moloci- l

narii, members of veiy different! ἰ , , ι

professions, 111 one and thel
same breath?

510. In this line the two
professions which mend old
garrnents are appropriately
mentioned together.

511. The strophium or mam-
millare and fascia was a kind
of belt worn to keep the female
bosom straight: see Smith's
Dictionary of Antiquities S. v.

512. cedunt = incedunt, comp.
colerezz‘ncolere v. 4.

513. trecenti denotes here
a great number or multitude,
much in the same way as se-
scenta v. 318. Hildyard quotes
the following examples of this
use: Cat. 9, 2. 11, 18. 12, 10.
Hor. od. 111 4, 79. See also
Plaut. Mil. gl. 250.—phyla-

are compared with jailers. The
