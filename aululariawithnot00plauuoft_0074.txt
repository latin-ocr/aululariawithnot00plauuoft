(313 INTRODUCTION.

certissimum, non eleqcmtc'am quandam intemwetandum
omnem hiatum esse, quam sint sectati poetae, sed licentiam
pocius quam ,sibi indulaerz'nts The truth of this aasertion
appears from Cicero's words (Or. ἓ 150) ‘nemo tam rus-
zicus est qai vocales ‘nolit conianyere? The only question
which is still sub iudice is therefore, how far the cornio
poets indulged in a license which we must admit they
used in their mem-es.

Parry, in his Introduction to Terence, p. LVII, sets
down three rules which would serve to explain the admis-
sihility of hiatus, viz.: hiatus, he says, is justified,

(l) by the sense of the passage,
(2) by the punctuation,

(3) 111 exclamations, such as heia hercle eleo heus.

Setting aside the third rule, which has indeed a general
value for all Latin poets, we confine ourselves to a more
‹letailed discussion of the first two rules. We may define
the matter more accurately 111 the following manner :—

Hiatus is justified :

(α) where the line is divided among two or more
speakers,
(b) by cccefflcra and diaeo-esis.

The latter point in its full extent was long disputed
by Ritscffl, but at last he began to allow a greater free-
110111 and to relax the severity of his original views, as
will be seen 111 the instance of the hiatus in the caesura
of the trochaic septenarius (praef. Men. p. x ss.) This
occurs 111 the Aulularia v, 174. 250. 638. But he does
not allow a hiatus in the caesura of an iambic senarius
‘ut quae in medium ordinem rhytlwnz'cum incidat ’ (Pron.
p. CXCVI). Still he (levi-ates from this law in such an 111-
stance as Trin. 342,

tempfist adeundi :: estne hic Philto qui advenit?

because in this case the line is divided among two
speakers. In the Aulularia we have two instances of
the same kind of hiatus, viz. 305 and 530:
