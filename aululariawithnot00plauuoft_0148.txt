tione.. The introduction of pure
Greek forms is one of the cha-
. racteristic features of the Au-
gustau period. Hence we have
iu the present passage PIrenam,
not PIrenen.

552. Hildyard appropriately
compares Massinger, City Ma·
dam 1 1 provision enozeyh to serve
a garris-on.

554. Appuleius imitatos this
passage in calling a fat lamb
aquus incuriosus Flor. 2. p.
113 ed. Bp„ whence it appears
that he found in his text the
gloss curiosam which has super-
seded the genuine reading curi-
onem. in all mss. The peculiar
meaning of curio is of course
coined on purpose for the pre-
sent passage. Euclio, too, ini-
parts to curio the sense of care-
worn.

556. Comp. ossa atque pellis
sum miser aem-[tudine ‘only skin
and bones' Capt. 1 2, 32. The
expression appears to be pro-
verbial: comp. Theoc. 11 89
αιῗταῖ δὲ λοιποὶ ὀ’στι’ ἕν’ ἧς καὶ
δέρμα. Horace has a similar
expression ossa pelle amicta
lurida Epod. 17, 22.

558. Ι have kept the form
lanterna as given by the ms, B ι
in the only other two passages

EV. turn tu

where this word occurs in Plau-
tus, Amph. prol. 149 and ib. 1
1, 249, B has laterna, and in J
the lines in question are illegi-
ble. In the line from the pro-
logue to the Amphitruo Ι should
propose to read Illic a portu
nunc cum laterna. advenit. For
lanterna see also Bficheler,
rhein. Mus. xvm 393 and W.
Schmitz ibid. mx 301. Com-
pare the French lanterne and
the Italian lanterna. The la-
terna Punica is only here men-
tioned3 WVeise says ‘ forte e
vitro facta:' and this opinion
seems not quite without foun-
dation, when we consider that
the invention of glass is gene-
rally ascribed to the Phoeni-
cians.—Beaumont and Fletcher,
poets who like to show off their
learning, manifestly imitate this
passage in ‘ The Scornful Lady ’
11 3 p. 301 ed. Lond. 1750:
‘Serv-v. Yonder's a cast of coach-
mares of the gentlewoman’s, the
strangest cattle. Wel. Why?
Serv. Why, they are trans-
parent, sir, you may see through
them.’
