AVLVLARIA.

[111. 1. 3—9.

neque ego umquang nisi hodie ad bacchas veni in
bacchanal coqumatum : 3
sta me miserum et meos discipulos fustibus male

contuderunt.

neque ligna ego usquam gentium praeberi vidi

pulcrius ε

itaque omnis exegit foras, me atque hosce onustos

sequitur: scio quam reni geram: hoc ipsus magister

me docet.

406. 1 have spelt the words
baccha and bacchanal with a
small b, because they should
rather be considered as general
‘terms than as proper nouus.
Plautus frequently mentions
bacchae: see Cas. v 4, 9 ss.
Mero. 469. (Vidular. fragm.
p. 483 Ern.) Bacch. 371. 53.
Amphitr. 11 2, 70 ss. Mil. gl.
1016. Men. 834 ss. Pseud.
109 S. In Greek, βάκχαι in
general means ‘furious women‚'
and the word has the same
sense in Plautus, where we
should not always think of au
allusion to the bacchanalia so
severely punished by the Roman
senate. It is not therefore ad-
missible to use this passage to
fix the time when Plautus wrote
the Aulularia—The verb co-
ᾳιιῖηαῖιιηι is attested by Nonius
and given by our mss: it is
therefore quite preposterous to
write coquitatum, as G. Hermann
and Goeller do. The same verb
occurs Pseud. 853 an τιῑ, coqui-
‘mitum te ire quoquam postulas
and ibid. 875 quanti ‘istuc unum
πιὲ coquinat-e percloces? In the
dictionaries we generally find it

marked with the wrong quantity
coquino; but coqu-ina- is de—
rived from coqu- in the same
way as car-ina- from σᾶν-
(Sauskr. skar laedere) ι carssnare
is used with this quantity by
Ennius, Ami. 181 and 229; al-
though Foroenini here again
gives carino, while Freund
rightly has carino. See also
Sauppe’s remarks on this point
in the Ind. schol. Gott. 1858-59
p. 10, where he likewise defends
the short quantity of the ἰ in
coquum.

407. Congrio calls the in-
ferior cooks (quinyentos coquos
v. 545) his ‘disciples‚' because
he has to direct them what to
do. In using the plural contn-
clerunt, Congrio continues the
simile of the bacchae, just as
if in Euclio an the Fur-ies
were represented together.

408. Instead of wood, which
was of course a necessary article
for cooks, Euclio most liberally
provides them withsztstes : on us-
tus fustibus meaning ‘ thorough-
ly thrashed.’——-li9na praebere is
known from Hor. Serm. 1 5,
