INTRODUCTION. 35

Thus we find dedic written as dede in three very old
inscriptions, O. I. L. 1 62¹³. 169. 180.
The preposition ad is thus often degraded to a simple
ἄ, e. g.
sed {d postremum. Poen. 1v 2, 22.
quis ed fores est? Amph. lv 2, 1.
et fid portitores. Phorm. 1 2, 100.
ut ῖιᾶ pauca redeam. Phorm. xv 3, 43.

But it would be superfluous to accumulate more instances
of this fact: we shall only add that even m was entirely
dispensed with in the rapid pronunciatiou of the time of
Plautus. Bentley has quoted in his Schediasma (p. xv
ed. Lips.) the following instances:

solent esse z solet esse.
student fdcere ε studefdcere.
habent despicata ε habe* despicate.

To these we might easily add other instances from Plautus,
but to prove the existence of such forms as we assume
here in the metres of the comic poets, we mention the p. xxxv.
form dedro, which in an inscription from Pesaro (O. I. L.
1 177) stands as an equivalent to dederunt. This form is
an unmistakable precursor of the corresponding Italian
form dieder0¹.

But precisely the same kind of form as is assumed
exists in emera = emerunt G. Ι. L. 1 1148, in an inscription
later than the second Punic war, but earlier than the Lex
J ulia de civitate sociis danda. This emera forms the
stepping-stone from emerunt to the secondary form emere.

The final letters m sr t d are more frequently dropped
than two others which we have yet to mention. The first
is l, which is sometimes cut off in the word semol (simul),
e. g. Aul. 617. Mil. gl. 1137. Ter. Eun. 11 2, 10. Haut. tim.
lv 5, 55²: the second η, which is dropped 111 the word
