The forms eius ei huius (huic) quoius quoi deserve

particular notice.

Of these quoi and kuic are always

monosyllables, while the others admit of a threefold

triple pronunciation z

All these forms occur in the metres of the comio p. lviii.

writers: we must, however, leave it to the industry of
our readers to collect as many examples of each separate
measure as they find sufficient for their own conviction.
Many instances of the varied metrica-l character of ei are
collected by RitschL opusc. 11 418 sq.

We shall now briefly enumerate some of the most
frequent cases in which i and u display their val-iable

nature. Thus we have

dies = dyas, dle = elye,

¹ Ι purposely do not mention
the oldest forms e-i-us ho-i-us
quo—i-us (tit. Scip. Barb. Ritschl.
pr. l. m. ep. t. 37), since they
are not found in Plautus and
Terence.

² To this head we may re-
fer the examples quoted above
p. 52. See Lachmann, 00111111.
Lucr. p. 27, and espcially p.
160 S. See also Corssen 11 672.

³ The spelling huis occurs in
an inscription in Gruter's col-
lection 44, 3: see Corssen, krit.
beitr. zur lat. formenl. p. 545,
and Schuchardt 11 503. In
Guyet’s edition of Plautus the
forms eis huis and quois are
several times found in the text.

⁴ This pronunciation must

be assumed for a line of Lu-
cilius: qnoizts voltu ac facie,
ludo ac sermonibus nostris.
(Lachmann, 1. l.) Lachmann
shows that this form left its
traces in cuicuimodi, 1. 0. quois-
quoisnwdi‚ the dropping of the
final s taking place as explained
above p. 30 s, The u disap—
peared much in the same way
as mayis presupposes an origi-
nal magius. The oldest ms,
gives cuicuiusmodi in Cic. Verr.
v 41, 107 which Halm is in-
clined to believe genuine.

5 The same theory applies to
such forms as νέἱ, rei, γὲ (ενέἶ) ;
spei spe‘i *spe (εεΡὲἶ) δίο. See
note on Aul. 607.
