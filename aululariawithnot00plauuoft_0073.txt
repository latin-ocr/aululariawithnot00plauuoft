INTRODUCTION. 6 5

We may finally draw the reader's attention to the
general fact that compounds in which two vowels come
together are always pronounced per synizesin in Plautus
and Terence, e. g. dein σίεῑήᾱα1 proin proindess dehinc
deorsum (written dorsum in an inscription C. I. L. Ι 199,
20) seorsum praffiptare praeesse deosculari. See also

G. HIATUs.

In order to complete our sketch of the pronunciation
of Latin as seen in the comic writers, we must also touch
upon a subject which is, however, one of the most diffi-
cult points in Plautine criticism, viz. tlte hiatus. After
the uncritical labours of Lingc, Ritschl was the first to
give some distinct and positive rules with regard to the
admission of hiatus in the metres of the comic Writers,
in the leth chapter of his Prolegomena, though his views
as given there were afterwards in many respects corrected
and enlarged by himself.

There is, at least, one point on which no doubt can
possibly exist, and this discriminates Bitschl⁷s views from
those of former scholars. We shall quote his own words³t
‘impeditior est de laicata quaestio. non dicam autem contra
eos qm· quovis et loco et modo admissum hiatum concocunt
concoctosque bonos versus concacant: quis enim lavare
laterem animum inducat? verum qui in ipsa caesura
senariorum admissum tutantur atque defensitant, eos certe
