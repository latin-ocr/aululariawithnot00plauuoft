18 INTRODUCTION.

We find, therefore, in Plautus a greater number os
instances in which the above-mentioned archaic long
vowels-have been shortened than where they still retain
their original quantity—and of this phenomenon we should
attribute the main cause to the influence of the accent.
But the development, having once commenced, did not stop
there3 on the contrary, many short quantities are to be
found in the comio poets which were either entirely re-

jected or but exceptionally admitted by later poets.

I shall first speak of the final vowels occasionally
shortened iu the rapid pronunciation of the times be-
tween the second and third Punic wars.

It will be observed that all the instances which we
are about to produce represent (lisyllabic words which
are used as pyrrlciclas, instead of their original iambit-
prosody. This could never have taken place, had they
been pronounced with the accent on the last syllable.

The long a of the first declension was not only short-
ened in the nom. and voc. (as it remained indeed ever
afterwards), but even in the ablativo, cg.

Ennius ed. Vahlen p. 94.

The same happened to the 0 of the dat. and abl. sing. of
the second declension‚ e. g. the abl. domo stands as a
pyrrhich in the following two instances:

unde exit? : : unde nisi domo :2 dome? :z me Ἀίᾶίθ :f egssissfidoe.
1 . g . .

domo quem profugiens d6minum apstulergit, tvendildi‘i.8
'ap . pro . .

In the abl. ioco the final o is shortened Bacch. 75, where
the reading of the mss. is as follows :

simulato me amare :z utrum ego istuc i6con adsimulem an serio?

tion destroyed the inflexional cented last syllables.

which shares the peculiarity of xvn. But see also Brix’s note

slurred pronunciation of unae· Miles gl.‚ p. 138.
