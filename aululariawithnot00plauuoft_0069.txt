It may readily be granted that in the prosody of the
comio poets many syllables had not yet received a fixed
and settled quantity, and that this fact was due to the
influence of the prose-accent or to the musical (rhythmi-
cal) pronunciation of that early time. Ennius, who was
the first to employ dactylic hexameters in Latin poetry‚
was obliged to settle the prosodiacal value of most of these
syllables 3 the reason of this was the very nature of his
metre, in which the arsis must invariably consist in one
lonq syllable, while the arsis of iambic and trochaic verses
may just as well consist of two short syllables—there
being moreover considerable liberty permitted as to the
treatment of the thesis.

The Latin differs from the Greek only in so far as the p. lv.
prosaic accent had already commenced to exercise an
important influence upon the quantitative value of many
syllables, when the language was first employed for lite-
rary purposes 3 many traces of this we have endeavoured
to point out in the metres of Plautus and Terence. The
vacillating and fluctuating system of Latin prosody was p. lvi.
afterwards entirely reformed by Ennius. He could not
violently alter what had already become the acknowledged
usage of the language, but in all those cases which were
not yet finally settled, the quantity preferred by him
was adopted by the subsequent poetS. A full discussion
of this point would, however, lead us beyond the limits of
this Introduction: at present we think it sufficient to
refer-to L. Mffller, de re metr. p. 69 and 70.

The notion of synizesz's rests on the ambiguous nature
of the two letters u and i, which may be used both as
vowels and consonants, and are in the latter quality fre-
quently expressed by v and y ¹. To these two we have to
add the letter e, which sometimes assumes the conso-
nantal sound of i (y). This is the case in the word deus,
