95. As regards the accentua-
tion pistillum I may here repeat
Ritschl’s expression on arqen-
tzim (Men. 930): ‘accentus non
insolentia at insuavitas,' Men.

100. On Bona Fortuna see
Preller Rom. Myth. p. 559. It
appears from a passage of Dio-
medes, that the words Bona
Fortuna te quaesivit were com-
*monly used in the sense of
nemo te quaesivit. In a frag-
ment of Afranius first pointed
out by L. Miifler (Rhein. Mus.
xx 374) we have an instance of
this expression3 it runs as fol-
lows: ‘Adulescens. num quis
me quaesiit? Servos. Bona
Fortuna.' There is, however,
no reason to suppose that Euclio
alludes to this, as is the opinion
of some commentators3 it is,

perhaps, morenatural to under-
stand the words simply such as
they are ‘Let nobody enter my
house, not even Good Luck it-
Self)

102. W'e need not suppose
that a temple of Bona Fortuna
was close to Euclio’s house.
There is a temple of Fides in
the vicfflity, into which Euclio
afterwards carries his treasure
(v. 575), and as there is also
Megadorus’ house on the stage,
we can hardly accommodate an-
other temple. There occur,
besides, no other allusions to
such a temple of Fortuna, which
would doubtless be the case, had
it been a necessary part of the
scenery. The adverb quaquam
is commonly used in nequaquam
and in haud quaquam (Sall.
Catil. 3). numquam quaquam
is a very strong negation ‘ never
by any means! Comp. ‘num-
