AVLVLARIA.

qui ea curabit, abstinebit censione bubula 15
nec sua opera rediget umquam in splendorem conr-

pedes.

595 nam erus meus amat filiam huius Euclionis pauperis:

eam ero nune renuntiatumst nuptum huic Megadoro

dari.

is speculatum huc misit me ut quae fierent fieret

particeps.

nunc sine omni suspitione in {tra hio adsidam

sacra :

hine ego et huc et illuc potero quid agant arbitrarier.

593. What censio bubula
means, should be clear without
further explanation : comp. how-
ever Trin. 1011 where the slave
Stasimus exhorts himself cave
sis tibi ne babuli in te cottabi
crebri crepent, and. Stich. 63
Antipho threatens his servants
vos monimentis conmonefaciam
bubulis. Slaves are therefore
called bucaedae Most. 884 : ibid.
882 we read (erus) male casti-
=‹Jabit eos exuviis bubulis.

594. The hiatus unquam ίη
is legitimate in the caesura:
see Introd. p. 66.

595. mvn indicates here no
internal, but only an exter-nal
connexion of the following sen-
tence with the preceding speech:
or, to speak more clearly, we
should supply such a sentence
as 6Ι make all these observa-
tions not in vain, for my master
etc.‘ nam is in this way very
frequently used by the comio
writers. See also on v. 27.—

huius, i.e. who lives here, in this
house. In the same way we
have huic Meyadoro in the next
line. He points towards the
house.

598. sine omni=sine ulla,
see note on v. Pla—suspitio is
the spelling frequently found
in the best mss. of Plautus,
Terence, Caesar, Cicero, Curtius
and Tacitus: the word is a con-
traction from suspicitio, an ety-
mology which at the same time
accounts for the different quan-
tity of suspm'o (noun) and sus-
picio (verb) suspicor. Another
theory is propounded by Cors-
sen, Beitr. p. 15 s.

599. arbitrarier is here :in-
spicere, comp. arbiter-:specta-
τον Capt. 208 and Poen. 111 3,
50. Milton has ventured to
introduce this sense of the word
into the English language‚ Par.
Lost 1 785 ‘while over-head the
moon sits arbitress.'
