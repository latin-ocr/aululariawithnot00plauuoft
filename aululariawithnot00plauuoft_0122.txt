300. ‘Some commentators
suppose, by follem is meant a
Ριινεε, bnt the plain and obvious
sense of tln‘s word appears to be
a kind of hay, which Strobilus
supposes Euclio to fasten to his
mouth and throat to catch his
breath in, while he is asleep.
The thought is extravagant,
but humorous.' Tnormrox.

302. guttur is masculine in
two other Plautine passages,
Mn. gl. 835, aud Trin. 1014.
Novius too has usque ad imum

a similar joke about a mean
Athenian, Patrocles, Plut. 84

’ἐκ Πατροκλέους ἔρχομαι, ὂς οὐκ

ἐλούσατ’ ἐξ ὅτουπερ ἐγένετο. This
however means that Patrocles
never took a bath since his
bn·th,··beeause he was too mean
to pay for it.

307. pote alone stands not
only for potes (e. g. Trin. 353)
and potest, but even for posse.
See Ritsohl, Proll. CXL—For the
so·called ‘great ’ talent, see
Smjth's Diotionary of Antiqui-
ties s. v. Talentum.
